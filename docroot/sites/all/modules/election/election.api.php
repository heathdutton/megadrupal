/**
 * Defines election types.
 *
 * Default election types are provided by the election_stv and
 * election_referendum sub-modules. Other types can be provided using this hook.
 * Information about existing election types is loaded via the election_types()
 * function.
 *
 * For working examples, see:
 *   election_types/referendum/election_referendum.election.inc
 *   election_types/stv/election_stv.election.inc
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array of election type arrays, keyed by a unique machine name. Election
 *   type arrays can include:
 *   - name: (Required) The human-readable name of the election type, sanitized.
 *   - description: A description of the election type, sanitized.
 *   - post name: The name of the election's posts, as a singular noun. See
 *     README.txt. The name for a referendum's posts may be 'question', while
 *     another election's posts may be referred to as 'role', 'position', or
 *     'title', perhaps.
 *   - post name plural: The plural version of the post name (default: post name
 *     + s).
 *   - has candidates: Whether the election type has candidates. Modules
 *     providing elections that have candidates should depend on the
 *     election_candidate submodule.
 *   - vote form: The name of a callback altering the voting form. This option
 *     is provided as a more convenient alternative to hook_form_FORM_ID_alter()
 *     to avoid complications with confirm form logic.
 *     The function takes the parameters:
 *         array &$form        - The form array from election_vote_form().
 *         array &$form_state  - The form_state array from election_vote_form().
 *   - export: Whether the election results can be exported as an archive of
 *     ballot (.blt) files. This needs the election_export submodule.
 *
 * @see election_types()
