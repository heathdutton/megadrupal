Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-01-21
-----------------------
- Most Views integration code has been replaced by the use of Entity API's
  EntityDefaultViewsController class. This may require some custom Views that
  involve election entities to be updated.
- When adding a new candidate type, the 'name' and 'e-mail address' fields are
  added automatically. They can be removed afterwards.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2014-01-05
-----------------------
- In a View listing posts, posts can now be hidden (via a JavaScript toggle) by
  the voter, according to whether the voter is eligible. The toggle will only
  display if there is at least one votable and at least one unvotable post. See
  <http://drupal.org/node/2114003>.
- The footer providing a note "candidates are displayed in a random order" has
  been removed from the default election_candidates View.
- There are now some functional tests for election voting access.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-12-22
-----------------------
- Candidates' names and e-mail addresses are now stored in fields, not
  properties. The database columns election_candidate.first_name,
  election_candidate.last_name, and election_candidate.mail have been removed.
  The candidate_name and candidate_mail fields are added automatically to all
  existing candidate types through an update function. New candidate types will
  also get these fields by default. To read the candidate name programmatically,
  use the function election_candidate_get_name().
- There is a new hook, hook_election_candidate_name_alter(), allowing modules to
  change a candidate's name before it is displayed. This potentially allows for
  'candidates' to represent things or ideas as well as people.
- The candidate 'Totals' page has been removed. A results summary was added to
  the election_candidates_admin View instead.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-12-15
-----------------------
- A step has been removed from the 'undo' process. It now takes 2 clicks
  instead of 3 to undo a vote or abstention.
- The election_vote and election_ballot tables now each have a column, 'valid',
  indicating whether a vote is still valid. It defaults to 1. Vote and ballot
  records will now NOT be deleted on 'undo'. When a user 'undoes' a vote or
  abstention, it will be marked valid = 0. If you are querying the database
  tables 'election_ballot' or 'election_vote', you must check for valid = 1.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-12-08
-----------------------
- There is now an 'Election Statistics' block that can be displayed on any
  election page to those with the permission 'View election statistics summary
  block'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-12-08
-----------------------
- Election posts (questions / positions) can now be unpublished. When running
  update.php, all existing posts will be set to published.
- There is a new tab on elections for administrators: "Manage posts" (or "Manage
  questions" or "Manage positions"). This makes it easy to publish or unpublish
  posts via Views Bulk Operations.
- Users are able to see unpublished posts and candidates if they have access to
  edit the election.
- Published candidates running for unpublished posts, or published posts inside
  unpublished elections, are still inaccessible to users who can't edit the
  election.
- For existing candidates, it is now possible to change the post (position)
  when editing the candidate.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-10-27
-----------------------
- The Rules action 'Deny voting access' now requires a third parameter: an
  explanation of why the user's access is being denied.
- The Election Vote module now contains a new feature: users can view an
  explanation of the voting access limitations for each post, if they have the
  permission 'view voting access explanation', and if they visit
  election-post/%election_post/explain.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-10-26
-----------------------
- The vacancies count for an election_post used to be in
  $post->settings['vacancy_count'] (and made available by the election_stv
  module). Now it is in $post->vacancy_count and the relevant form field and
  display is managed by the election_candidate module. This is to prevent voting
  from running where there are fewer or equal candidates than vacancies, by
  default. See: https://drupal.org/node/2115031

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-28
-----------------------
- The previously undocumented hook hook_election_results_page_alter() now no
  longer provides $totals as a parameter. The function
  election_results_get_totals() has been added.
- The function election_referendum_count_votes_by_answer() has been added.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-19
-----------------------
- Issue #1994932 by ricky.middaugh: Added a setting to show or hide the
  Candidates tab on an election.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-16
-----------------------
- Issue #1995704: Added hook_election_candidate_post_has_enough_alter(),
  allowing other modules to help determine whether a post has 'enough'
  candidates for voting to be possible. See
  election_candidate/election_candidate.api.php for details.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-05
-----------------------
- Election editors are now able to add candidates via an 'Add new candidate'
  form. So the permissions 'bypass nomination schedule', 'bypass nomination
  exclusivity', and 'allow duplicate nominations' have now been removed as they
  are no longer useful. The form ID 'election_candidate_edit_form' has been
  changed to 'election_candidate_form'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-04-13
-----------------------
- Tagged as 7.x-1.0-beta14: as a consequence of the previous change (see below),
  many internal simplifications to the Election Condition submodule have been
  made, including the removal of a database table. If you have previously had
  the Election Condition module enabled, you will need to run update.php (or
  drush updb).

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-03-25
-----------------------
- API change in Election Vote module: removed hook_election_vote_access() and
  replaced it with hook_election_vote_before_grant(), which takes one less
  parameter. There is also a new Rules event, 'Before granting access to vote',
  and the corresponding action 'Deny voting access'. See election_vote.api.php.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-27
-----------------------
- API change: removed 'save votes' callbacks, replacing them with a new hook,
  hook_election_vote_ELECTION_TYPE_save(). See election_vote.api.php.
- API change: a 'vote form' callback now has the same function signature as
  hook_form_alter(). See election.api.php.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-24
-----------------------
- Many changes to theme-related things such as render arrays, theme functions,
  and some string changes and CSS tweaks.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-17
-----------------------
- Removed Views field handler linking elections to their candidates tab.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-26
-----------------------
- New submodule: election_export, which takes over the ballot file (.blt) export
  functionality which used to live in the election_stv submodule.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results download form'
  which is now no longer used. The key 'export' (Boolean) now defines whether
  results can be exported & downloaded. This requires the election_export module
  to be enabled, and the election type needs to support candidates. See
  election.api.php.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results page' which is
  now no longer used. To change the results page, modules should implement
  hook_election_results_page_alter(&$output, $post, $totals). But this will soon
  be replaced by a theme preprocess hook.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-16
-----------------------
- Default stats groups in theme_election_statistics() are now arrays, not
  stdClass objects. See election_statistics_get_totals().

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-05
-----------------------
- Changed the default name of referendum posts from 'motions' to 'questions'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-03
-----------------------
- Issue #1856998: converted the 'Thank you for voting' and 'You have abstained'
  messages into default Rules.
- Issue #1841644 - added 'Elected' and 'Defeated' as candidate statuses. They
  have no special meaning or effect, yet.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-09-05
-----------------------
- Added a 'candidate types' admin system. You will need to run database updates
  (API change).
- The above means that nomination forms are now per post, not per election (UI
  change).
- Removed the 'phone' column from the election_candidate table, adding a default
  Field instead.
