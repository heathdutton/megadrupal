Upgrading from Drupal 6
--------------

Drupal 5 and 6 versions of this module extended the related Mailman Manager module (http://drupal.org/project/mailman_manager). The Drupal 7 version of User Mailman Register is a standalone module that does not rely on Mailman Manager (which, in fact, does not have a Drupal 7 version). If you are upgrading a site from Drupal 6, you should leave Mailman Manager and User Mailman Manager both installed (but disabled) when you perform your site upgrade. Once you've completed the upgrade, you can safely remove the Mailman Manager module files.

Donation
--------

The User Mailman Register module is not sponsored by anyone, but I [ST] develop and support it during my spare time for free. If you gain something thanks to it or you want to support its development, you can consider making a donation following instructions on the module project page.
