DESCRIPTION
===========

The quickbar module lets one choose a menu as a toolbar that shows up on
the top of the page.


INSTALLATION
============

1. Install & enable the module.

2. Go to admin/config/user-interface/quickbar

3. Choose which menu applies to which role.


GRAPHICS
========

The icons used by the admin module were designed by Young Hahn and
AJ Ashton specifically for use with Drupal's admin interface.
The iconset is available for use under a dual GPL/BSD license,
meaning you may choose the license which is most appropriate for
your project.


THEME COMPATIBILITY
===================

A theme can specify its compatibility with different features
provided by the quickbar module in its .info file. If no compatibility
flag is set, quickbar assumes the theme is compatible with all of its
features.

To disable the quickbar menu when using your theme:

  quickbar[] = 0
