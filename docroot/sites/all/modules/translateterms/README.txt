This module provides an easy and quick way to translate vocabulary terms. 
When using the Internationalization module to translate the terms of a 
vocabulary, you might find this very tedious and time consuming. The process 
will take you trough a couple of screens for each term you want to translate.

Meet "Translate Terms". This module will offer you a tabular overview of all 
"to be translated" terms as well as the functionality to translate on the fly, 
within the same screen.

Translate Terms targets any administration role that has the permission to
translate and edit vocabulary terms.
