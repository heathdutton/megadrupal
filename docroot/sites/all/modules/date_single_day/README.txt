This module alters date popup fields so they only show a time for the 'To' field.
Use this if you know your dates always start and end within 24 hours and you want
to save your users entering in a date value twice.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration can be found under a date popup field's edit form. Enable the
module by checking "Show single day" under "More settings and values > Date single day".

Optionally, you can select "End after midnight", if you want the user to specify a time
interval that spans over two days.
