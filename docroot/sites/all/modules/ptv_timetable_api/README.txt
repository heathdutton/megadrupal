INTRODUCTION
------------

The PTV Timetable API has been created to give the public direct access to
Public Transport Victoria's public transport timetable data. The API allows you
to query locations for scheduled timetable, line and stop data for all
metropolitan and regional train, tram and bus services in Victoria
(including NightRider). It also includes real-time data for metropolitan tram
and bus services (where this data is made available to PTV), as well as
disruption information, and access to myki ticket outlet data.

The PTV Timetable API module is a third-party integration module for
Australia Public Transport Victoria Timetable API. It provides a clean wrapper
class to allow user call PTV timetable API in object oriented way.
