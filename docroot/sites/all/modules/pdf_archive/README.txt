The PDF Archive module provides the ability to generate PDF archives of any
entity triggered by Rules actions. Both the entity view mode and role of the
simulated user used for rendering the entity can be set per rule.

An example feature is included to demonstrate the configuration of this module.

PDF Archive was written Stuart Clark and is maintained by Stuart Clark
(deciphered) and Brian Gilbert (realityloop) of Realityloop Pty Ltd.
