SMS ENVAYA
----------

Envaya SMS module provides an SMS Framework gateway for the EnvayaSMS 
Android app.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

After installing and enabling this module, configure it at 
admin/smsframework/gateways/envaya. For each device running the 
EnvayaSMS app, enter one line consisting of the phone number, a space, 
and the password. These values must be the same as those configured in 
the EnvayaSMS Android app.

The server URL will need to be configured under the EnvayaSMS settings 
on the Android device. Simply add "sms/envaya" to the base URL of your 
Drupal site. For example, if your Drupal site is available at 
"https://example.org/" then you would set the server URL to 
"https://example.org/sms/envaya".
