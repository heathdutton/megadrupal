* Module Description
This module helps us to find the block details which are assigned with 
particular page.

* Install and Use
After installed this module, you will get a menu tab called 
"Blocks By Page URL" in admin/structure/block page.

In this interface by entering the page path 
(ex: node/29, contact/service, <front>), you can see the block details.

On the result, Drupal's front end theme's region information will be shown.
