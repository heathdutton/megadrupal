FLAG NOTIFY DRUPAL MODULE

A simple but flexible notification solution that uses the great flag module for
email notifications of site activity and optionally integrates with organic
groups.

** Required modules**
Flags
-> you set the flags for subscribing as per your requirements (using the flags
settings page) and then tell this module which ones to use
-> tested with version 3.0, but it **should** works also with Flag 2.x.

** Suggested modules **
Queue mail
-> it put emails on a queue instead of firing them all at once
-> add the flag_notify send emails function in the queue configuration page
(add "flag_notify_*" in the "Mail IDs to queue" form under
admin/config/system/queue_mail page). 

Views + View bulk operation
-> it can provides users with nice views of the group/content/comment they
subscribed
-> not provided by flag_notify but easy to implement on each site

** INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **

1) Download and enable the Organic Group module before Flag Notify if you want
to use group notification
2) Download and enable this module like usual
3) Create the flags for comment, content and group notification (e.g.
"Subscribe to this content") on admin/structure/flags.
Any of these three levels is optional.
4) Configure Flag Notify under admin/config/system/flag_notify
5) Optionally create a view (suggested using View Bulk Operation) to allow
users to manage their subscriptions.

** Troubles **
1) If you install the og module AFTER having installed this module and you want
to use this module for notification of group activity you have to manually edit
the field "field_notification_defaults" to include a default option for group
activity notifications and give it the 'group' key, e.g. in "allowed values"
you will have:
group|Activity in the groups you join
content|New comments and modifications on content you create
comment|Replies to your comments
These defaults affect only new users, so if you install this module on a
established site you have to give users the default options you require.
