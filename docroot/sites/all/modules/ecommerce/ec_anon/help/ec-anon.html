  The ec_anon module is responsible for purchasing policy setting and
  enforcement. For example, purchasing policies can allow or deny anonymous
  customers from buying a product. Policies can also restrict a product, such
  as a trial membership, to only be available to new customers. A purchasing
  policy can be set as a site-wide policy that products default to. Policies
  can also be set per-product to override the site default.

  Anonymous customers can register for a user account during checkout if the
  policy is set to %Flexible or Anonymous only. Both standard and express
  registration methods are supported. Drupal natively performs a standard
  registration where the user must confirm their email address before
  continuing through the checkout process. An express registration is possible
  by installing the <a

  module and selecting Set password &amp; Immediate login for the Allow user
  to set their password during registration setting.
