<p>PayPal as a part of their service can be set up to send Instant Payment
Notification (IPN) messages to your website to notify e-Commerce or other
system of an event that has occured. These messages can be telling your
website that a payment has been made or a new subscription has been created.
Also it can tell you more important information such as the fact a payment
has been successful or it has failed. This will then allow e-Commerce to
take the required action.</p>

<p>This IPN request may or may not be in the desired format. This can occur
because the system has been migrated to e-Commerce and now existing
subscriptions have a new id. Instead of getting all customers to recreate
their subscriptions, we can alter the IPN request to have the new
subscription numbers in them.</p>
