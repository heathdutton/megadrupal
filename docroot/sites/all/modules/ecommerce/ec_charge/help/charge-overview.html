  Additional charges is a method for the store owner to add extra line items
  to a transaction. These line items can be anything that is required. Fixed
  shipping charges, actual shipping costs used with API to pass information to
  shipping companies. Also handling charges and discounts can be done using
  this system.

  Since there are an infinite number of ways to charge a customer this system
  does not assume how the store owner can build a charge and what methods that
  will be used. So this system is complete extensible and new components can
  be added by a developers to do any additional method that is required. But
  there are a number of built-in components which can be used by the store
  owner to build the charge as they need. This should cover most requirements
  but there is always methods that the system does not know about such as
  shipping calculation interfaces which will need to be built by developers
  and released.
