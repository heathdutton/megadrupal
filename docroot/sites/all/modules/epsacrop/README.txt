-- SUMMARY --

EPSA Crop is a module that allows a user to choose coordinates for different
styles on an image. If a user defines coordinates EPSACrop will create a image
with the points.

If the user doesn't change the coordinates, the normal crop process is applied.

You can try out a demonstration of the Drupal 6 version of this module, here:

-- REQUIRENENTS --

EPSACrop requires that the following module is enabled:
 - Image

EPSACrop requires that the following external libraries are installed:
 - JCrop (http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html)
 - json2 (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js)


-- INSTALLATION --

1. Download the EPSAcrop module and place it into your modules directory
   (ex. sites/all/modules or sites/all/modules/contrib)

2. Download and unpack the JCrop library. Rename the resulting directory to
   'Jcrop' and place it in one of two locations:
    1. (recommended) If you are using the Libraries API module, place the Jcrop
       directory into the libraries directory (ex.: sites/all/libraries/Jcrop).
    2. Alternately, you may place the Jcrop directory into the epsacrop module
       folder (ex.: sites/all/modules/epsacrop/Jcrop)

3. Download the and unpack the json2 library. Rename the resulting directory to
   'json2' and place it in one of two locations:
    1. (recommended) If you are using the Libraries API module, place the json2
       directory into the libraries directory (ex.: sites/all/libraries/json2).
    2. Alternately, you may place the Jcrop directory into the epsacrop module
       folder (ex.: sites/all/modules/epsacrop/json2)

4. Go to admin/build/modules and enable EPSA Crop.

   the field display settings are located at
   Structure -> Content Type -> {type} -> Manage display. Select the image style
   chosen in step 3 again to see your cropped image display.
