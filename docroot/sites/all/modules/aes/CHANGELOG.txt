 * Various fixes.

6.x-1.4 -> 7.x-1.4

 * Ported the module to Drupal 7.

6.x-1.3 -> 6.x-1.4

 * This module now supports the AES implementation provided by PHP Secure Communications Library (phpseclib). Which means that this module no longer requires PHP's Mcrypt extension (although it still supports it alongside phpseclib). Thanks to queen.zeal for bringing this library to my attention. Issue: http://drupal.org/node/579858 and of course many thanks to Jim Wigginton for writing this great library, which can be found here http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/.

 * There's now an automatic trim() on decrypting data. This change is partly because the phpseclib implementation does this, so it's now also done in the mcrypt implementaton to maintain consistency between implementations, and partly because it has caused to some confusion/concern among several users (though it was not actually a bug).

 * Fixed a faulty implemented form. Thanks to rjmackay. Issue: http://drupal.org/node/507892

 * aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt will now return false if passed empty strings instead of raising errors. (Several issues has been discussing this and I believe there has been various reasons to it happening depending on your site settings and installed modules).

 * Requirements are now checked at install, thanks AlexisWilke. Issue: http://drupal.org/node/436368

 * Plus other minor changes which shouldn't affect the function/behavior of this module in any significant way.

5.x-1.2 -> 6.x-1.3
 
 * Ported the module to Drupal 6.
 
 * AES no longer alerts the user about a missing key if the user does not have the administer aes permission. This alert is now also logged in the watchdog.

5.x-1.1 -> 5.x-1.2
 
 * Fixed a faulty use of preg_match which caused a warning in PHP 5.2.x.
