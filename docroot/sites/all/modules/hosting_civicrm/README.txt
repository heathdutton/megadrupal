Hosting CiviCRM
===============

This module provides tools to manage CiviCRM [1] in the Aegir Hosting System
[2]. In other words, it will handle the installation of CiviCRM, generate the
civicrm.settings.php file, handle upgrades, manage the CiviCRM crons and the
CiviCRM API site key, and so on.

Installation
============

As of version 3.2, this module has been included in the Aegir distribution, as
part of the "Golden contrib" initiative. As such, it is automatically available
to be enabled without the need to deploy any code. For older versions, follow
these steps:

- Copy the module to your /var/aegir/hostmaster/sites/aegir.example.org/modules/
- Enable the module: drush @hostmaster en hosting_civicrm -y
- In Aegir, give the 'configure site CiviCRM cron intervals' permission to admins.

If you are using the Debian package for Aegir and you would like to
automate the installation of the module on new Aegir installs, you
should use a custom makefile so that the module is not lost after an upgrade:
http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading/debian#Custom_distributions

For convenience, a "drush make" makefile is available in drush/civicrm.make.


Debugging
=========

If you are having problems running the crons, try:

  drush '@hostmaster' hosting-civicrm_cron --items=5 --debug --strict=0

Credits
=======

Initial development was by Mathieu Petit-Clair [3] during the CiviCRM code
sprint in San Francisco of spring 2010, with the help of Deepak Srivastava [4]
who wrote the CiviCRM drush module.

Maintenance and development was then continued by Mathieu Lutfy [5], with the
help of many contributors [6] and with great support from the CiviCRM core team
and community. Front-end components were later added by Christopher Gervais [7].

Ongoing development and maintenance by Coop SymbioTIC [8], Praxis Labs Coop [9]
and Ergon Logic Enterprises [10].
