
DESCRIPTION
------------

This module is intended for use by module developers. You should
only install this module if directed to do so by another module.

Allow a generic way to handle groups of users and extend groups
that users can be part of in the system. If you wish to be able
to define groups that users can join or leave using an interface,
see the Organic Groups module.

Developers, see the usergroups_api.api.php file for hooks available
to extend the usergroups_api module.
