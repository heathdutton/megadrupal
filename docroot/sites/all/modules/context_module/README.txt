The Contextual modules module allows for Drupal module to be enabled and
disabled via the Context module.

The module was written for the purpose of disabling UI related modules on
production servers and enabling developer modules (devel, delete_all) on
development servers.

Contextual modules was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
