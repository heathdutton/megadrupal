COMMON STEPS (*REQUIRED*)
===================

You should follow these steps in order to install this module.

Step 1
---------
Download this module and extract it in sites/all/modules as usual.

Step 2
---------
Download the converse.js library from this address:
https://github.com/hejazee/conversejs_drupal/archive/master.zip

Then extract it to sites/all/modules/conversejs/lib/converse.js
You should rename the folder so that you have the converse.js
file at this location:
sites/all/modules/conversejs/lib/converse.js/converse.js

Step 3
---------
Download xmpp-prebind-php library from this address
https://github.com/hejazee/xmpp-prebind-php/archive/master.zip

Then extract it to sites/all/modules/conversejs/lib/xmpp-prebind-php
You should rename the folder so that you have the XmppPrebind.php
file at this location:
sites/all/modules/conversejs/lib/xmpp-prebind-php/lib/XmppPrebind.php

Step 4
---------
Download the latest version of jquery_update module and install it.
https://drupal.org/project/jquery_update

Then go to: admin/config/development/jquery_update
Choose Default jQuery Version to be at least 1.7
You may want to use more recent version of jQuery.
But converse.js requires jQuery version 1.7 or later.

Step 5
---------
Download the latest version of token module and install it.
https://drupal.org/project/token

Step 6
---------
Go to module administration page: admin/modules
and enable the conversejs module.

Step 7
---------
You can configure module's permissions. But default permissions are OK for
a quickstart. You can customize them later when you need.

Step 8
---------
Go to conversejs administration page: admin/config/services/conversejs
and configure it. There is enought detailed instructions about all fields
on that page.
For a quick start, you only have to configure the following options:

- without Auto-Login:
  If you want your users see a login dialog where they can enter their XMPP
  username and password and login to the chat room.
  You need only provide BOSH server address.
- with Auto-Login (Recommended):
  If you want your users to be automatically logged-in in the chatroom,
  You should enable the Auto-Login option.
  Then you'll need to provide XMPP credentials.

NOTE 1: For now, Please do not enable the Built-in proxy.
  Because that needs a little extra configuration.

NOTE 2: Please go to "Setting up the XMPP server" section on this document.
  And read all instructions to get a working XMPP and BOSH server.
  Then come back here and follow.

From now, I assume that you have read the instructions
in "Setting up the XMPP server" section on this document.

The most inetersting option with this module,
is to enable the Auto-Login feature.

Please enter the BOSH address in Converse.js settings page and enable the
Auto-Login checkbox, and fill all XMPP options.
Do not fill "User's full name". Leave it blank.

Then click the Save configuration.
Now open your site's home page and check if it's working.
(If you enable Auto-Login, then loading the chatroom may take a while)

Step 9
---------
If you have any problems, please see the TROUBLESHOOTING.txt file.


Setting up the XMPP server
===================

This module depends on a XMPP service with BOSH interface.
You can setup your own or use an already available server.
Below, you can find instructions about various solutions, in this document.
Please choose an option and follow it.


Using free public chat servers
===================

The easiest way to get up and running with this module, is to use a public
chat server like jabber.org or ch3kr.net.
You can also use https://bind.opkode.im/ as your BOSH server.

Note: you can always use jabber.org for your XMPP service, but you should
not rely on https://bind.opkode.im/ for your BOSH server.
(I'm not sure whether this service is reliable or not; It seems that it's only
for demonstration use)

I'm going to use ch3kr.net for this quick start.

Step 1
---------
Go to this address and sign up for an account:
https://jabber.ab-storm.de/register

Step 2 (Optional)
---------
You can download an XMPP client from here:
http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/

For windows and linux, I recommend Psi+ and Gajim.
Pidgin is also a good software.
For android, I recommend Yaxim.

You can test your ch3kr.net account with your XMPP client.

Step 3
---------
If you signed up for ch3kr.net, your BOSH address will be:
https://bosh.ch3kr.net/
and your XMPP domain will be either ch3kr.net or ch3kr.de

Now go back to Step 8 of "COMMON STEPS" section and use these informations.
