You need to run the web driver first and then start the behat tests.

## Start the web driver
### Selenium 2 default (Firefox)
    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar
### Chrome
    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.44.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="chromedriver"
### Phantomjs
    phantomjs --webdriver=8643

## Run the test
    bin/behat

# Troubleshooting
## Tests donâ€™t run and break at the first step.

    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role                            # Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\DrupalContext::assertAuthenticatedByRole()
    (RuntimeException)

Your drush alias might not be configured correctly. Try to run "drush @local status" in your test directory to debug.

## "bash: drush: command not found"

Behat directly executes the drush command on the environment via ssh. Files like .profile or .bashrc will not be executed. Symlink your drush command into /usr/local/bin or try http://stackoverflow.com/a/10564729 (did not work for me on my puphpet vagrant vm)
