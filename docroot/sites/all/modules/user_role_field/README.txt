This module allows you to specify role specific fields. When creating
a new field, you specify for what roles this field is enabled.

Fields are only visible and editable if an account has a specific
role.

This role does not determine access controls for visible fields, use
the field permissions module for that. When a field is visible, it can
be edited. If a field is not visible, it cannot be edited, not even by
the administrator.
