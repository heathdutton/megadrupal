The Widget Token module provides token integration for the Vlaamse Infolijn
Widget platform.

Use case
--------
Most users are given a restricted set of tags that can be used to insert in
richtext fields. To overcome this problem, the Widget Token module provides a
simple token pattern [widget:?]. In combination with, e.g. Token Filter, the
token pattern will automatically be replaced with the correct embed code without
user intervention.
