INTRODUCTION
------------

  The Custom Sitemap module allows users/site admins to add custom sitemaps to a
  site, unlike currently available module that binds users to build a sitemap
  using the primary menu.

  This module enables you to add or promote random URLs from SEO viewpoint. It
  also facilitates you to add independent sitemaps for all domains in a multi
  domain Drupal setup. This also helps you to have a domain specific custom
  sitemap.

INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING

See http://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib for instructions on
how to install or update Drupal modules.

Once Custom Sitemap is installed and enabled, you may upload your sitemap file
at "http://yoursite.com/admin/config/search/custom-sitemap".
You may view your sites sitemap at "http://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml".

Uploaded sitemap files are stored in custom_sitemap folder within files folder
of your drupal installation.
