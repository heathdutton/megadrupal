This module was supposed to be my 'awesome' drush module with the greatest
text UI in the world, But frankly, I failed, the code is spaghetti and way
more complex than it needs to be, It's a mess.

But it works anyway, And since it's a temporary module (Which means you would
probably disable it after you're done with it) and works, or even better, you
wouldn't install this in production environment, I leave it as is till somebody
will fix it (thanks to that someone ;) 

I wont have time to fix it, Cause I'm tired of PHP and going back to python and
Java. This is probably my last module.

I love Drupal's community and I will always do, no matter what happens to PHP
or Drupal itself :)
