Drush support
-------------

To use Drush support, you must move the subprofiles.drush.inc file that comes
with subprofiles to a location accessible to Drush.

Here is an adapted excerpt relevant section from the Drush help:

You can put this file in a number of places:

- In a .drush folder in your HOME folder. Note, that you have to make the
  .drush folder yourself (so you end up with ~/.drush/subprofiles.drush.inc).
- In a folder specified with the include option.
- In /path/to/drush/commands (not a Smart Thing, but it would work).

When subprofiles.drush.inc is accessible to Drush, you can install or
reinstall an installation profile with the following command.

`drush subprofiles-site-install [profile_name] [subprofile_name]`

The --features option can be used to specify exactly which of a subprofile's
features should be enabled.

For example, to install the minimal subprofile of the openoutreach profile with
only the debut and debut_article features enabled:

`drush subprofiles-site-install openoutreach minimal --features=debut,debut_article`
