-- SUMMARY --

The Web Experience Toolkit 4 (WET_BOEW) menu module is part of a suite that
implements the Web Experience Toolkit (v4.x) front-end framework into Drupal.
The framework, lead by the Government of Canada, is open-source and
collaborative, and is made to be accessible, mobile, and responsive. You can
find the full documentation here: http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index.html.

The Web Experience Toolkit distribution (https://www.drupal.org/project/wetkit)
is a content management system. If you prefer an out-of-the-box system, please
refer to the distribution.

This suite is meant for site builders who prefer to have a bit more control and
 provides a simple roadmap for upgrading WET components. By decoupling the
 features and leveraging Drupal’s module and theming system, we are able to
 provide quicker theme updates and keep the WET overhead low.

This module creates the menu that is used in the WET4 theme. It creates a page
at /menu/export that meets the WET specs in order for the JS framework to
format properly with drop downs and, if applicable, collapsible elements.

A demo of the menu can be found here:
http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/demos/menu/menu-en.html.
