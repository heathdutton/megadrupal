Description
-----------
This module simplifies the assignment of workbench access sections in
hierarchical select field by replacing workbench access default check box
field, which is a greatly enhanced way for letting the user select items
in a hierarchy.

The assigned section will be displayed in the dropbox and will provide
remove link to remove the assigned items.

This module will work for both the Taxonomy and Menu system.


Installation
------------
1) Place this module directory in your "modules" folder (this will
usually be "sites/all/modules/"). Don't install your module in Drupal 
core's "modules" folder, since that will cause problems and is bad 
practice in general. If "sites/all/modules" doesn't exist yet, just 
create it.

2) Enable the module.

3) Go to "admin/config/workbench/access/settings" or
"admin/config/workbench/access/sections" to configure "Access scheme"
and "Active editorial sections".

Dependencies
------------
1. Workbench Access
2. Hierarchical Select 7.x-3.x-dev
