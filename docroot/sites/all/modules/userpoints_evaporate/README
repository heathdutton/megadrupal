== Userpoints Evaporate ==

This module implements a cron hook that simply subtracts a set number of
userpoints from each entry in the {userpoints} table every set interval.

It also writes proper records to the {userpoints_txn} table, so users can
see when and how many points have evaporated.

It does this by running two SQL queries via hook_cron.


== Requirements ==

To make use of userpoints_evaporate you will need to install the userpoints
module. http://drupal.org/project/userpoints  You must also periodically
run the Drupal cron script.


== Installation ==

Extract the module to sites/*/modules and enable it via the module admin
page.


== Configuration ==

Browse to http://localhost/?q=admin/settings/userpoints_evaporate to change
evaporation settings.


== Caveats ==

The userpoints module does not create an index on the points column in its
table, but this module uses that column in a WHERE clause. That means that
if it has a LOT of entries (i.e.: if you have a lot of users) the queries
executed by userpoints_evaporate may be very slow. Until issue #792944 is
addressed, you cna add the index manually:

  ALTER TABLE userpoints ADD INDEX 'points';

Once (if) userpoints.module is updated, you will need to drop this index
again before you run update.php.
