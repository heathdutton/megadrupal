The aim of this module is to give a more dynamic and customisable PayPal 
donation button as the default one. 
You can:
* create predefined amounts
* select a custom amount
* use single and recurring donation
* set up a header logo for your PayPal page
* send a thank you e-mail
* define a thank you page after successful payment

On the other hand this module has IPN callback implementation, which means 
you can:
* list the details of the payment in Drupal

This module is creating two blocks on the site, 
one for single donations and an another one for recurring donations.
