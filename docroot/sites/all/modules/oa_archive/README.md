OPTIONAL. Renames the Trash Flag module options to Archive.

The Trash Flag module is used to flag content that is being archived
(soft-deleted).  The oa_archive module simply uses a Features Override export to
change various text, such as "Trash This" -> "Archive This".

TODO: Ultimately, the Trash Flag module should be modified to allow
configuration of these titles and text.
