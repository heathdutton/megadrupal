The Widget Block module provides block integration for the Vlaamse Infolijn
Widget platform and supports the following integration methods:

 - Embed
   Integration uses an embed to include a widget.

 - Server Side Include
   Integration uses Server Side Include to embed a widget. Server to server
   communication is required between the Vlaamse Infolijn Widget platform and
   the integration website.

 - Smart-Server Side Include
   Integration uses Server Side Include to embed a widget. However all the
   different assets, e.g. javascripts, stylesheets and content, are passed
   separately which allow for seamless integration.
