"Footer Message" module developed by Sean Larkin at ThinkShout. Contact me at: http://thinkshout.com/contact.

Description:
* This module provides a site footer message, editable on the site-information form and displayed as a block, as well as presented as a theme variable.
* The module replicates the "site footer" feature from Drupal 6.x. for Drupal 7.x sites.
* Note: A migration path for Drupal 6.x sites is underway. Needs some cleanup.

Installation & Usage:
* Download and enable this module.
* To edit the footer message, go to: http://example.com/admin/config/system/site-information.
* The footer message block can be placed on your site via the block administration screen, or with Context module.
* Or, $footer_message can be added to your page.tpl.php.
