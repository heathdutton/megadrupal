Version Control / Project Node Integration -
Integrates project nodes (provided by the Project module)
with version control systems supported by the Version Control API.


SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
This module makes it possible for users with a VCS account to associate
project nodes with repository locations and appoint co-maintainers for these
projects, which enables commit access control based on project maintainership.

Version Control / Project Node Integration depends on the
Version Control API and Project modules.
