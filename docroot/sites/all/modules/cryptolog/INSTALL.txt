INSTALLATION
------------

Before installing Cryptolog, you must install either the Memcache
Drupal module, the APC PHP extension, or the XCache PHP extension.

In addition, PHP must have been compiled with IPv6 support enabled.

To enable Cryptolog, add this line at the end of your site's
settings.php file:
$conf['cache_backends'][] = 'sites/all/modules/cryptolog/cryptolog.inc';

If you have installed Cryptolog module somewhere other than
sites/all/modules then modify the file path accordingly.
