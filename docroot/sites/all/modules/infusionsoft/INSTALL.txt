Install
----------

To get started using the API, you will need to go through an initial set-up
process. The result of the setup process will be an encrypted key that you
will need for authentication.

1. Enable the Infusionsoft API and generate an API Key, instructions here:
   http://ug.infusionsoft.com/article/AA-00442
2. Write down the encrypted key - it will be essential to getting the API to work
3. Install the drupal module in the usual way. See here for more information
   http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes
4. On your Drupal site fill out the information on admin/settings/infusionsoft.
