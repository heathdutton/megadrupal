Instructions for updating to version 2.4
========================================
In this update, all resource lists are converted to single embedded resources.
Before running the update, you should manually edit the field 'cp_resource' in
the field collection 'cp_section_resources_embedded' and set the number of
values to 'unlimited'. This will allow the update script to read *all* the
entries in the resources lists (not only the first ones).

Once the update script has been run, you should turn the field back to single
value.

Sorry for the need for manual intervention on this one.
