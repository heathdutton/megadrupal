There is a hidden agenda for this project. That agenda is to make teacher share
learning resources with each other.

There are tools and even some libraries available with exactly this objective.
At least in Sweden, they don't work very well. Basically all teachers think it's
a good idea to share resources and help each other, but very few actually do so
beyond the most basic level.

Why? There is no time to spare. So taking the extra few minutes to share an
exercise, a test or a tutorial is seldom done. It takes time to learn how to
share, it takes time to give the resource a final polish before sharing, and it
takes time to do the actual sharing. So teachers end up reinventing the wheel,
each on their own, every single day.

On the surface, this is a project where teachers can do course planning. This
will save time from day one.

But then a teacher may discover that they can upload resources they have, and
that, too, will save time. And voila â€“ you have teachers making resources
available for each other.

We'll see how it works.
