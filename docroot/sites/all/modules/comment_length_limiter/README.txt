Comment limiter module by Esben von Buchwald

This module adds extra fields to the node edit form and lets you specify the
max length of comments for specific nodes, and allows you to disable the
subject field.

When the comment form for a node with limited comment lengh is shown, a small
char-counter will be appended.

All you need to do is to enable the module and enjoy.
