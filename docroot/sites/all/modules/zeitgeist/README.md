Zeigeist is a search history module written for Drupal 4.7.x to 7.x.

In its first versions, it just provided blocks displaying a list of recent 
searches, but since the Drupal 6 version, it provides two blocks displaying a 
list of recent searches, and a list of top searches over a fixed time span, as 
well as a default report page.
 
It is expected to add additional features, typically search frequencies over 
various time spans.

The versions for Drupal 5.x to 7.x should work with all database back ends
supported by Drupal. Earlier versions are only validated on MySQL, but should
also work on PostgreSQL. Other databases might work, but will not take advantage
of engine-specific code for MySQL/PostgreSQL.
