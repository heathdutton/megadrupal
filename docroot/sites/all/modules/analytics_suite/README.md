Highly configurable module providing analytics framework. Can be used to implement analytics suites like Omniture and Google Analytics (and many more!).

Out of the box it allows to control tags with URL patterns, user roles and API. It also uses Tokens to inject dynamic variables into tags.

Configuration uses CTools exportables, so it's fully deployable with code.
