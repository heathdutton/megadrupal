SimpleTest Fixture 7.x-[RELEASE], [DATE]
---------------------------------
by al.ex: implemented cache rebuild after fixtures have been generated.
  Fixes a caching issue of tests that use entities.

by Carsten MÃ¼ller:
  * added a check if the order of table columns in the db matches the Drupal schema.
    If not, the schema order will be reordered accordingly to fit insert into
    select statement.
  * added check if column type in db table matches the column type in the Drupal
    schema to avoid problems.
  * added debug option in fxg drush command and added drush_print commands for better debugging
  * added splitting of table content copying if there are too many values in the db table
  * added administration interface to exclude tables form content copying,
    including default settings
