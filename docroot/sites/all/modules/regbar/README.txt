DESCRIPTION
-----------

"Regbar is an icard generator application that creates icard containing
barcodes for each user during registration & then one can print using either
the default template or specified template.

Barcode can contain username or it can be random strings to give uniqueness
to ICard, which can be read using barcode-reader & generated barcode is easily
configurable [width, color etc] using settings page.

Using this module, website authors can easily provide seperate icards to the
registered users which can be used mainly in conference or any event & sorts
out the problem of seperate icard generation.
You can try out live demonstration of it here:
