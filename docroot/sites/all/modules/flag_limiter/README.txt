## Flag limiter is a supplement to the Flag module.

This module allows any flag (for example: bookmarks) to have both absolute- and user-specific limits added to it. So for example, you could limit one page to be flagged up to 15 times and limit individual users to only 2 flags of that type. 

This provides some interesting usages as an alternative voting or signup system.
