FARM FIELDS
===========

Provides common base field definitions for farmOS entity types.

This module is not concerned with "fields" in the farming sense (see
[Farm Area](http://drupal.org/project/farm_area) for that), but rather
in the Drupal Field API sense. It provides fields for storing commong
things like images, files, descriptions, dates, etc on Drupal entities
in farmOS.

This module is part of the [farmOS](http://drupal.org/project/farm)
distribution.
