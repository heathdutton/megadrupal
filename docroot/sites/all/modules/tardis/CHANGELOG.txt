TARDIS: Changelog
=================

7.x-2.2, 2013-07-16
-------------------
TARDIS' latest release for branch 7.x-2.x adds the TARDIS Token submodule, for
customizing TARDIS page titles and link texts. There's also some documentation
fixes and minor code cleanup.

7.x-2.1, 2013-05-23
-------------------
It has come to my attention that the last update didn't include the latest code,
even though the dev version did. Oh well. Here it is, then.
Sorry about that: I'm still learning the ropes.

7.x-2.0, 2013-05-21
-------------------
TARDIS' first stable release for branch 7.x-2.x adds the TARDIS Render
submodule, for selecting in which view mode will nodes be displayed. There's
also some documentation fixes (like in this very file).

7.x-2.0-alpha2, 2013-05-17
--------------------------
Major fix: Fixed unpublished nodes being included in the TARDIS query.
Minor fix: Fixed obsolete variables weren't deleted on upgrade.

7.x-2.0-alpha1, 2013-05-16
--------------------------
This version fixes redundancies from the 7.x-2.x-dev branch, moving them into
dedicated functions.

7.x-2.x-dev, 2013-05-14
-----------------------
On this new version, TARDIS gives users the ability to create multiple blocks
and pages. Naturally, submodules TARDIS Date and TARDIS Internationalization
also benefit from this upgrade: there's Date and Internationalization for each,
separately.

7.x-1.2, 2013-04-11
-------------------
Third stable release. TARDIS has a second submodule, TARDIS Date. Fixed some
bugs related to TARDIS Internationalization, documentation, settings and
variables that were left over during uninstall.

7.x-1.1, 2013-04-04
-------------------
Second stable release. TARDIS now has its first submodule, TARDIS
Internationalization, and has been moved to its own group in admin/modules.

7.x-1.0, 2013-03-27
-------------------
First stable release. No new features. Marks the beginning of development of
planned features in Roadmap.

7.x-1.x-DEV, 2013-03-27
-----------------------
Released after much anticipation and a thorough review by ycshen, Samuel Joos,
FlakMonkey46, 20th, klausi and cweagans. Includes a block and a page, with
assorted options.
