TARDIS Token
============

The TARDIS Token module adds token functionality for TARDIS page titles and
block links. Now you can have your very own words!

That pretty much means slapping a labelmaker on the good ol' time machine and
naming anything the way you want it!

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and edit any TARDIS page or TARDIS
block you created (or create a new one).

3. Scroll to the bottom and look for the "TARDIS Token" vertical tab. In there,
change titles for each scenario accordingly. Please note: anything you don't
name will rever to default settings.

4. Save and profit!
