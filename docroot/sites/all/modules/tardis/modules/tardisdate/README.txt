TARDIS Date
===========

The TARDIS Date module adds date field functionality for TARDIS results. Now
you can filter results using any date field!

That pretty much means travelling to any point in time, in any alternate
reality - sort of!

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and edit any TARDIS page or TARDIS
block you created (or create a new one).

3. Scroll to the bottom and look for the "TARDIS Date" vertical tab. In there,
choose a desired date field in "Date field to use". Please note: nodes of a type
that does not share the date field you select won't come up.

4. Save and profit!
