TARDIS Internationalization
===========================

The TARDIS Internationalization module allows language filtering for the nodes
retrieved from the TARDIS query.

Now you can not only time travel to any node in the past, but also anywhere in
the world! ;)

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and edit any TARDIS page or TARDIS
block you created (or create a new one).

3. Scroll to the bottom and look for the "TARDIS Internationalization" vertical
tab. In there, choose your language(s) under "Languages". There's also "Current
language" and "Undefined" for fine-tuning of results.

4. Save and profit!
