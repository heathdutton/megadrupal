TARDIS Render
=============

The TARDIS Render module allows selct view modes to be used for displaying nodes
retrieved from the TARDIS query. No integration with Display Suite is needed,
but if you have DS installed you'll be able to create extra view modes.

Also while tou you don't need a sonic screwdriver, having one is pretty cool.

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and edit any TARDIS page you created
(or create a new one).

3. Scroll to the bottom and look for the "TARDIS Render" vertical tab. In there,
choose the desired view mode. Please note: nodes of a type that does not share
the view mode you select will render as full nodes.

4. Save and profit!
