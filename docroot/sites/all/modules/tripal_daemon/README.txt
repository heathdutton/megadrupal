INTRODUCTION
------------
This module is meant to provide a simple means of creating a robust
command-line-driven, fully bootstrapped PHP Daemon. It uses the PHP-Daemon
(https://github.com/shaneharter/PHP-Daemon) Library to create the Daemon (via
the Libraries API) in order to not re-invent the wheel ;-).


FEATURES
--------
 * Provides a Drush interface to start/stop your Daemon.
 * Your daemon starts in the background and is detached from the current
   terminal.
 * Daemon will run all Tripal Jobs submitted within 20 seconds.
 * A log including the number of jobs executed, their identifiers and results.
 * Lock Files, Automatic restart (8hrs default) and Built-in Signal Handling &
   Event Logging are only a few of the features provided by the Daemon API
   making this a fully featured & robust Daemon.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
 * Libraries API (https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries)
 * PHP-Daemon Library version 2.0 (https://github.com/shaneharter/PHP-Daemon)
 * Drush 5.x (https://github.com/drush-ops/drush)
 * Drush Daemon API (https://www.drupal.org/project/drushd)

INSTALLATION
------------

   module. See:https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7

   directory. The folder must be named "PHP-Daemon".

Tripal Daemon from the command-line.
