This is really simple module.
It requires VideoJS module to be installed before.
It replaces [videojs:{video_file}|poster:{poster_file}|width:{width}|height:{height}] to video with VideoJS player. {video_file} is required argument.

Instillation & setup.

Turn on module, go to text formats page and turn on filter.
Put you videos in some separate folder in Drupla files directory,
align settings on admin/config/media/videojs

and have a good time :-)
