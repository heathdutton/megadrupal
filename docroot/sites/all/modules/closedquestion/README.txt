-- SUMMARY --

The Drupal module ClosedQuestion adds the Closed Question node-type to Drupal
that takes an XML question definition and displays this question to users.
The ClosedQuestion-nodes are stand-alone and can be used anywhere a normal node
is used.

Features
 * Designed for practice: students can take as many attempts as they like.
 * Many feedback options, feedback can change with attempts.
 * Many question types.
 * Questions can be used anywhere.

Comparison with Quiz
Quiz is made for quizzes. This makes Quiz mainly suitable for testing knowledge,
less for learning. Quiz has:
 * One try per question.
 * Very limited feedback.
 * Limited number of question types.
 * Questions do not work outside of a quiz.

-- DESIGN --

A ClosedQuestion node is a fully self-contained question that can be answered by
a user just as it is.

During node_load an object of type CqQuestionInterface is added as
  $node->question

During node_view $node->question->getOutput() is called, which returns a
complete Drupal form containing the question.

The submit handler for this form is
  closedquestion_submit_answer($form, &$form_state)
which redirects to
  $node->question->submitAnswer($form, $form_state);

If an external object like a ProteusQuiz node or LinearCase node wants to track
the progress of the user, it has several options:
 * Add a listener to the $node->question. This listener is called when the user
   answers the question correctly for the first time and whenever the question
   generates feedback.
 * Call isCorrect(), onceCorrect(), getTries() on $node->question.
 * Look at $node->question->getAnswer(), which returns a CqUserAnswer object
   that contains the answer of the user.

-- API --

This module invokes two hooks, allowing you to hook into the saving/loading
of user answers:
 * hook_cq_save_answer($nid, $uid, $answer): Called when user saves an answer
 * hook_cq_load_answer_alter($nid, $uid, &$answer): Called when user loads
     answer
 * hook_cq_reset_answer($nid, $uid, $data): Called when user resets answer
