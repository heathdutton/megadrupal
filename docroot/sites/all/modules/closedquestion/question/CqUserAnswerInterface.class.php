 * UserAnswer is an interface and implementing classes for storing a users
 * answer, the number of tries a user needed so far, and wether a user has given
 * a correct answer at least once. The "answer" can be any serializable data
 * type.
 *
 * Changes to the answer, tries or correct status is not written untill the
 * store() method is called.
 *
 * The number of tries should, in general, not be increased for "correct"
 * answers.
 *
 * If the "correctness" has been set to TRUE once then the value of onceCorrect
 * will be set to the current number of tries + 1. Further changes to the
 * correctness will not change this value any further. This is done so the
 * student can explore a question for feedback even after answering a question
 * correctly.
 *
 * UserAnswer can also store additional data key/value pairs for a question,
 * using the getData and setData methods.
