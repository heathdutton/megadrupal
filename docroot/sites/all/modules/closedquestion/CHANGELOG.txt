________________________________________________________________________________
Version 0.39 was the last non-Drupal.org release. From this point ClosedQuestion
is a Drupal.org hosted module and versioning will be changed to reflect this.


Version 0.39
 * The inlinechoice attribute of the range match is now treated as regular
   expression. This allows one range to check multiple inlineChoices. By default
   the range will match true if any of the inlineChoices matches.
 * The range match now has a "matchAll" attribute. A non-zero value causes all
   of the inlineChoices matched by the inlineChoice attribute to be checked. The
   range will only match true if all of the inlineChoices match.
 * The <match> element is changed:
   - The hotspot attribute now accepts regular expressions, this makes the
     hotspotpattern attribute superfluous.
   - The draggable attribute now accepts regular expressions, this makes the
     draggablepattern attribute superfluous.
   - A new attribute "matchAll" is added. When doing inlinechoice/pattern
     matching a non-zero value will cause all selected inlinechoice answers to
     be matched and the <match> will only return true if all selected
     inlinechoices match. When doing hotspot/draggable matching there are three
     accepted values:
     (h)otspots: All selected hotspots should have one of the selected
                 draggable.
     (d)raggable: All selected draggables should be on one of the selected
                  hotspots.
     (b)oth: All selected hotspots should have one of the selected draggables
       and all selected draggables should be on one of the selected hotspots.
 * Started work on advanced-help pages.
 * Option-specific feedback in multiple-answer questions is now also shown when
   the answer is correct.


Version 0.38
 * In this version the file closedquestion/question/XmlLib.inc.php was moved to
   closedquestion/lib/XmlLib.inc.php. If you upgrade by copying the new version
   over the old version, make sure to delete the old file.
 * Check questions, with inline feedback now use the feedback-blocks. This means
   that this question type can use AHAH submits like all other question types.
 * The question-form-element can now be surrounded by html without using the
   prefix and postfix xml tags. If you place a <formblock/> tag in your question
   text the question's form will be placed at that position in the text. This
   means you can now embed the question in for instance a table, so you can
   display information next to the question.


Version 0.37
 * Feedback can appear anywhere in the question-text by putting a
   <feedbackblock id="some_id" /> placeholder in the spot the feedback should
   appear, and adding a block="some_id" attribute to the feedback tag.
 * Inline does not filter using the normal filter api and thus would not filter
   content loaded through AHAH, such as the feedback. We now call the Inline
   filter function ourselves, if Inline is enabled for a question.
 * In all places where the attribute "identifier" is used the alias "id" can be
   used instead.


Version 0.36
 * EvalMath now has a proper list of function aliases.
 * Added min, max, floor, ceil and number_format (nf) to EvalMath.
 * Cleaned up argument gathering for built-in functions in EvalMath.
 * Improved check for unknown XML nodes.
 * The match element "range" can now also check if the value of a variable
   is in a certain range, not just the value of a user's answer. for example:
   <range maxval="20" maxval="a" value="c" />
   checks if the value of variable "c" is above 20 and below the value of
   variable "a".


Version 0.35
 * Fixed a bug that caused target boxes in Select & Order questions to not have
   the correct titles.
 * ClosedQuestion now depends on Autoload, make sure you enable that module
   first if you upgrade!
 * Lots of cleanups to make the code ready for drupal.org
 * Integrated EvalMath so questions can generate values using math expressions,
   see examples/fillblanks2.xml.


Version 0.34
 * [attachurl:...] now also matches against the user-changeable file description
   and not just the non-changeable filename.


Version 0.33
 * Fixed image map typo. Adding descriptions to areas in hotspot and drag&drop
   questions now correctly highlights the area (if JQuery map highlight module
   is active) and shows hovertips (if the hovertip module is active).
 * Added hook_user to delete a users answers when a user is deleted.
 * In MC questions, the "Pick One" or "Pick any number" prompt can be changed by
   adding a <prompt>Your prompt</prompt> tag to your question. Adding an empty
   <prompt /> will remove the prompt altogether.


Version 0.32
 * Better adherance to the Drupal coding standards.
 * Fixed bug in hotspot questions that did not generate the answer unless a
   crosshair was moved (just clicking did not work).


Version 0.31
 * Fix to allow logs to be shown on other content types than ClosedQuestion.
   Any content type that uses CqUserAnswer (like Proteus) can now show logs
   using the CQ views.
 * Fixed use of jquery parentElement where parentNode should be used. This broke
   the Select&Order question in some browsers.


Version 0.30
 * Small update to the CqQuestion interface.
 * More documentation.


Version 0.29
 * Fixed access-denied problem for AHAH submits on questions.


Version 0.28
 * Questions now use AHAH to submit the answer and load the feedback.


Version 0.27
 * Added view-based page that shows the log of the tries of a user for a
   question.


Version 0.26
 * NOTE: Some files have been (re)moved. It's best to delete the old version
   before upgrading.
 * Select&Order questions now use Mappings like D&D, Hotspot and Fillblank
   questions. Old style xml still works normally, so old questions do not need
   to be updated.
 * Check (Multiple Answer) questions can now have more than one correct
   combination of answers by using mappings, just like Select&Order questions.
   Each option needs an "identifier" attribute, while the "correct" attribute is
   ignored.


Version 0.25
 * Added view-based page that shows which users attemted a question.


Version 0.24
 * Added hook_requirements to check for XML libraries.


Version 0.23
 * Added attribute "stop" to mapping, to indicate no further mappings should be
   evaluated if the current mapping matches.


Version 0.22
 * Removed debug output
 * Warn for duplicate identifiers in S&O, D&D, Hotspot and FillBlanks questions.
 * Added groups of items for FillBlanks questions. An inlineOption can have a
   "group" attribute and an inlineChoice can display only items from a certain
   group.


Version 0.21
 * Horizontal Select&Order now works in IE too (Thanks Koos).
 * Horizontal Select&Order can have fixed Item-height.
 * Added prefix and postfix tags to question. With these you can for instance
   add an image next to a question. Make sure to use <![CDATA[  ]]> if your html
   would result in invalid XML.


Version 0.20
 * Added ImportExportApi bindings.
 * Removed "teaser" toggle form edit form.


Version 0.19
 * Changed CqQuestion to an interface and created CqQuestionAbstract
 * Added function onceCorrect() to CqQuestion class.

   support that tag.

   is used.

 * Show answer options in Text view of Select&Order question.


Version 0.12

   by using attribute correct="-1"


Version 0.9
 * Make module not give a fatal error when question xml is not correct.


Version 0.8

Version 0.7
 * Fix error on preview.
 * Make sure UserAnswer doesn't do anything with either session or database if
   there is no node_id.


Version 0.6
 * Dependency on jquery_update, as Select&Order needs a newer version of jquery
   than Drupal core has.
 * Small visual improvements to S&O questions.


Version 0.5
 * Fixed "Duplicate entry" error when telling userAnswer twice to save data.
 * Added missing <pre> element to XML parser.
