<p>If you have a question where a student has to calculate a result form given
  data it would be nice if you did not have to give fixed ranges for the correct
  answer, but if the question calculated those from the given data. It would
  also be nice if the question would give different numbers each time a student
  makes the question. That is now possible with ClosedQuestion using the
  <strong>&lt;matheval /&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;mathresult /&gt;</strong>
  tags.</p>

<p>Lets start with an example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;question type="fillblanks"&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="a=random()" store="1" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="b=random()" store="1" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="a=round(a*0.8+0.11,2)" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="b=round(b*5+2,0)" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="ans=a*b" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="min=min(round(ans,1),(ans-0.01))" /&gt;
  &lt;matheval expression="max=max(round(ans,1),(ans+0.01))" /&gt;

  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have measured a concentration of &lt;mathresult expression="a" /&gt;mg/ml in
       a &lt;mathresult expression="b" /&gt;-times diluted sample.&lt;br/&gt;
       What was the concentration in the non-diluted solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The original concentration was: &lt;inlineChoice identifier="c" freeform="1" /&gt;g/l&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;

  &lt;hint mintries="1"&gt;That's not correct.&lt;/hint&gt;
  &lt;hint mintries="2"&gt;
    The concentration in the non-diluted solution is higher than the measured concentration.
  &lt;/hint&gt;
  &lt;hint mintries="3"&gt;
    The correct answer is: &lt;mathresult expression="a" /&gt; * &lt;mathresult expression="b" /&gt;
     = &lt;mathresult expression="ans" /&gt;.
  &lt;/hint&gt;

  &lt;mapping correct="1"&gt;
    &lt;range inlineChoice="c" minval="min" maxval="max" /&gt;
    &lt;feedback&gt;Very good.&lt;/feedback&gt;
  &lt;/mapping&gt;

  &lt;mapping correct="0" stop="1"&gt;
    &lt;not&gt;&lt;match inlineChoice="c" pattern="^[+-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(e[+-]?[0-9]+)?$" /&gt;&lt;/not&gt;
    &lt;feedback&gt;Please give a number.&lt;/feedback&gt;
  &lt;/mapping&gt;
&lt;/question&gt;
</pre>

<p>There are two new tags in this example: <strong>&lt;matheval /&gt;</strong>
  and <strong>&lt;mathresult /&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>&lt;matheval /&gt;</strong> tag evaluates an expression. Matheval
  nodes are placed directly in the &lt;question&gt; node.</p>
<p>The <strong>&lt;mathresult /&gt;</strong> tag evaluates an expression AND puts
  the result in it's place in the text. Mathresult nodes can be placed anywhere
  where output text is placed, like for example in the &lt;text&gt; node and in
  &lt;feedback&gt; nodes
</p>

<p>The example first generates two random numbers (between 0 and 1) and stores
  those in variables a and b.
</p>

<p><b>store="1"</b> in a <strong>&lt;matheval /&gt;</strong> means all variables
  up to that expression are stored and loaded the next time a student visits the
  question. Expressions with store="1" are only evaluated on the first visit. So
  in our example the values of variable a and b are stored. This makes sure that
  when the student "reloads" the page to give his answer, the variables stay the
  same.
</p>

<p>Next the variables a and b, that have a value between 0 and 1, are changed to
  have the required range and precision. Variable a is now between 0.11 and 0.91
  with a two decimal precision, while b is a whole number between 2 and 7.
</p>

<p>Then the answer is calculated from a and b, and stored in the variable ans.
</p>

<p>Lastly the minimum and maximum values that will be considered "correct" are
  calculated form ans. By using this trick with min() and round() we make sure
  that the student has to give a precision of at least one decimal, but can give
  more if he wants to.
</p>

<p>In the question text the different variables are displayed using the
  <strong>&lt;mathresult /&gt;</strong> tag that evaluates an expression and
  displays the result.</p>

<p>When a <b>&lt;range&gt;</b> tag finds a non-numeric value in the <b>minval</b>
  or <b>maxval</b> attributes it will check of the given value is a math variable
  that was previously defined. If so, it will use the value of that variable.
</p>

<p>Variable and function names have to start with a letter.</p>

<p>All variable and function names are case insensitive, the whole expression is
  converted to lower-case.</p>
