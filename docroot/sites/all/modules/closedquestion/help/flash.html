<p>The Flash question type allows you to use a flash movie, or any other client
  side technology like a Java applet, as a question. All question logic is done
  on the client side. The flash movie can save several types of data to
  closedquestion:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>answer</dt><dd>The answer field is for data that the user entered, or data
    that changed because of user actions.</dd>
  <dt>data</dt><dd>The data field is for data that is different for each user,
    but not changing because of actions of the user. In math questions this is
    used to store the generated random numbers that the current user is seeing.
    Obviously you do not want these numbers to change for each answer attempt
    the user takes.</dd>
  <dt>tries</dt><dd>The number of "tries" the user has made so far. This might
    not make sense for every type of interaction.</dd>
  <dt>correct</dt><dd>Whether the current state of the users actions is
    considered to be a correct answer. The current state should be the data
    stored in the answer field, given the data stored in the data field. <b>This
    field is stored, but not retrieved</b>. On load the correctness of the state
    should be deducted from the loaded answer, given the loaded data.</dd>
  <dt>onceCorrect</dt><dd>Whether the user has ever achieved a "correct" state.
    <b>This field is retrieved, but not stored</b>. The value of onceCorrect is
    the value of "tries" + 1, at the first time a non-zero value of "correct" is
    stored.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If after doing a set of interactions the state is considered to be a correct
  answer, then the state should still be considered to be a correct answer after
  leaving the question and coming back later.</p>

<p>Once the state is considered "correct", a post should be done with a non-zero
  value for the "correct" parameter. From this point on, the value of the
  "onceCorrect" parameter will be positive, to indicate that the student has
  reached a correct state at least once, even if the current state is no longer
  considered correct.</p>

<p>It is advisable to allow the student to continue exploring the interaction
  even after finding a correct answer. This allows the student to check feedback
  on possible incorrect actions and improves learning.</p>

<p>The page containing this question will respond to the following get/post
  variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get and Post:
    <ul>
      <li>action=getAnswer: returns the current answer, or an empty page when there is no answer.</li>
      <li>action=getData: returns the current data field, or an empty page when there is no data.</li>
      <li>action=getInfo: return the current user's data, formatting in the way
        specified in the format field. The data consists of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>username: The current user's username.</li>
          <li>firstname: If there is a profile field "profile_firstname" then the data of this field is returned.</li>
          <li>middlename: If there is a profile field "profile_middlename" then the data of this field is returned.</li>
          <li>lastname: If there is a profile field "profile_lastname" then the data of this field is returned.</li>
          <li>tries: (int) The number in the tries field.</li>
          <li>onceCorrect: (int) The number of tries that was listed the first time the correct variable was nonzero.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>format: The format to return the data of getInfo in. Possible values:
        <ul>
          <li>flash: return as flashvars (& seprated key=value pairs)</li>
          <li>xml: xml data formatted as: &lt;data&gt;&lt;key1&gt;value1&lt;/key1&gt;...&lt;/data&gt;</li>
          <li>json: {"key":"value"}</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Post only:
    <ul>
      <li>action=store: Will read (and store) the following variables, if set.
        <ul>
          <li>answer</li>
          <li>data</li>
          <li>tries</li>
          <li>correct</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
