To get started with "Where I Am": 

1) Download the Location module if you still didn't do so

2) Enable the Location and User Location modules

3) Setup User Locations at admin/config/people/accounts/settings to support AT LEAST city and address 

4) Enable the "Where I Am" module

5) Enable the "Where I Am" block in some region

6) Enjoy using it!

To make best use of "Where I Am" you should setup a gmap view (http://www.drupal.org/project/gmap) of nodes sorted by distance from user's Latitude / Longitude fields. 
This will allow Drupal to become an "Around Me" application allowing the user to setup his position and showing all nearbiest locations (nodes).
