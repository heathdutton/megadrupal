"Empowerment Interventions for Older Adults",,,"Education","http://www.systemseed.com/","Read More","Introduction To Business","<p>There has been much discussion regarding the need to empower older adults to make informed health decisions and to test interventions targeting empowerment to promote health among older adults. It has been suggested that an empowerment approach may nurture an older adult's participation in health care decisions and promote positive health outcomes.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to report the findings of a critical review of published empowerment intervention studies with community-dwelling older adults. A descriptive literature review was conducted to examine how empowerment is conceptualized across interventions, the guiding theoretical frameworks, the outcomes measured, as well as the health outcomes of these interventions. Based on the findings from this review, recommendations for future empowerment intervention research with older adults as well as implications for practice are proposed.</p>","Parrish McIntyre","Western Journal of Nursing Research","November 10 2013, 12:00"
"A cancer screening intervention for underserved Latina women by lay educators",,,"Education","http://www.systemseed.com/","Read More","Current Issues in Management","<p>Inadequate screening adherence for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer among Latinas places them at greater risk for poor survival rates, once diagnosed. The purpose of this study was to examine two delivery methods of lay health educators (promotoras de salud) to increase screening behavior and evaluate costs.</p><h4>METHODS:</h4><p>This community-based group randomized trial assigned Latinas due for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening (n=1006) to promotora-taught cancer screening/prevention classes delivered individually (IND) or in social support groups (SSG) over 8 weeks. Screening behaviors were assessed immediately after and 3 and 15 months after intervention. Intervention costs per study arm were compared.</p><h4>RESULTS:</h4><p>Screening and maintenance behaviors were not significantly different between SSG and IND for any one type of cancer screening, but with a study entry requirement that participants were either never screened or due for screening, postintervention screening rates (that is, completing a screening that was due) were notable (39.4% and 45.5%, respectively). The cost of achieving any one screening was much higher for IND participants.</p><h4>CONCLUSIONS:</h4><p>SSG vs. IND delivery did not significantly affect cancer screening behaviors, but both interventions produced robust achievement of screenings for previously nonadherent participants. Group-based promotora-led interventions supporting social involvement are recommended as a more cost-effective approach to achieving cancer screening among Latina women.</p>","Anthony Fox-Davies","Journal of Women's Health","December 13 2013, 16:00"
"Building personal and professional resources of resilience and agility in the workplace",,,"Education","http://www.systemseed.com/","Read More","Business Law","<p>This article describes the rationale, implementation and results of a pilot study evaluating the personal and organizational impact of an educational intervention on the stress of health team members&nbsp;The compelling imperative for the project was to find a positive and effective way to address the documented stress levels of healthcare workers. Pilot study of oncology staff (n=29) and healthcare leaders (n=15) exploring the impact of a positive coping approach on Personal and Organizational Quality Assessment-Revised (POQA-R) scores at baseline and 7â€‰months using paired t-tests.</p><p>Personal and organizational indicators of stress decreased in the expected directions in both groups over the time intervals. The majority of POQA-R categories were statistically significantly improved in the oncology staff, and many of the categories were statistically significantly improved in the leadership group.</p><p>The findings from this project demonstrate that stress and its symptoms are problematic issues for hospital and ambulatory clinic staff as evidenced by baseline measures of distress. Further, a workplace intervention was feasible and effective in promoting positive strategies for coping and enhancing well-being, personally and organizationally.</p>","Tom Kirkpatrick","Stress and Health","February 05 2014, 15:30"
