1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 {Already an interesting point, Kramnik doesn't play
the
Petroff and had to be prepared to face Kasparov's Scotch Game with 3.d4.
Kasparov
in turn decided to play a Ruy Lopez rather than his normal Scotch} 3.Nf6
{Kramnik
plays the rare Berlin Variation. The last time this was played in a World
title match
was by Korchnoi in 1981 against Karpov. Karpov won very easily.}

{At the end of the game Kramnik said he had "defended precisely" and he was
happy
with his position at the end. He decided not to try and exploit his time
advantage as he
regarded Kasparov's position as not being especially hard to play. Both
players
seemed happy enough to draw in what was a tense first game. - Mark Crowther}
