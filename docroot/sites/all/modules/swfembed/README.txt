DEVELOPING WITH SWFEMBED

This module is intended for developer use. You may want to take a quick look
at the source code (there are commented out examples) or see the handbook page.

The Flashy module (http://drupal.org/project/flashy) uses this module to 
provide flash video support. That, also, is a good source of information on 
the workings of this module.
