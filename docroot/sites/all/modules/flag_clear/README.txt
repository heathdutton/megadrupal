Overview:
--------
This module provides functionality to remove user flags for nodes and other entities. Instead of requiring a user to login and remove the flag, the admin now has the ability to remove the flags as well. This functionality is often useful in user-submission use-cases, where users do not necessarily unflag the content that.


Flag Manager:
-------------
This module also includes an administration panel, called 'Flag manager'.
This page lives at '/admin/config/content/flag-manager':
