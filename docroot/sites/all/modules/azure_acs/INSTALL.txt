ACS configuration
-----------------
Follow these instructions, for example:
http://acs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=WordPress%20Plugin
(disregard the WordPress-specific parts)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only SWT 1.0 tokens are supported at the moment, so be sure to
select that as your token type in ACS.

Drupal configuration
--------------------
After enabling the module, go to admin/config/people/azure_acs.

From there, you must set the site namespace and token signing key. You may also
choose to create user accounts automatically for unregognized users (enabled by
default) and allow linking different identity providers with the same user
account (regognized by email address obtained from the identity provider).

In the blocks interface, you may enable the block "Windows Azure ACS identity
providers", which will provide you with a list of login links for identity
providers you have configured for your site. You are also free to implement your
custom solution (such as including the links in a login form) by utilizing
azure_acs_get_identity_providers() and the theme azure_acs_providers.
