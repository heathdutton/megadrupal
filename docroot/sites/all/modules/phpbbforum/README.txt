  +/root ---------------------> +(phpBB root path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/phpBB3/)
    +/images -------------------> +/images (/home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/images)
        
    +/includes -----------------> +/includes
      +/phpbbdrupalbridge
        phpbb_api.php             phpBB api file name: phpbb_api.php
  
    +/styles -------------------> +/styles
      +/prosilver-embed ----------> +/prosilver-embed
      +/subsilver2-embed ---------> +/subsilver2-embed
      +/subsilver2 ---------------> +/subsilver2

    functions_user-embed-3.0.9.patch  --> +/phpBB3/functions_user-embed-3.0.9.patch
    (for functions_user.php only)
    phpBB-embed-3.0.9.patch ------------> +/phpBB3/phpBB-embed-3.0.9.patch
    (for the whole phpBB including patch for functions_user.php)

  4) Apply patch to phpBB
    
    1. If you do not want to use embedded mode "In the Drupal page", you should apply functions_user-embed-3.0.9.patch only

    copy ... root/functions_user-embed-3.0.9.patch  to  .../phpBB3/functions_user-embed-3.0.9.patch
    
    2. If you want to use embedded mode, you should apply phpBB-embed-3.0.9.patch
 
    The patch is made from clean phpBB3-3.0.9.
    All changes made by the patch do not affect the standalone behavior of phpBB3.

    3. Go to phpBB directory.

      cd /phpBB3

    4. If you are upgrading from previous version of the module, you may wat to restore the original 
    phpBB source files from previous patch.

      patch -p0 -R < phpBB-embed-3.0.8.patch    
      
    5. Patch phpBB. Choose appropriate filename for your patch and version of phpBB.

      patch -p0 < phpBB-embed-3.0.9.patch
      
    See http://drupal.org/patch/apply for details or if something is wrong.

    6. Remove patch from phpBB root directory  
 
  5) Copy .../root/images directory to Drupal directory.

     If you do not want it, you will have to edit phpBB file editor.js for your phpBB theme
     (/phpBB3/styles/prosilver-embed/template/editor.js) and enter the url, 
     where the file spacer.gif resides.
     
     (function colorPalette(dir, width, height) line 335)
     
     The relative path img src="/images/spacer.gif" provides access to spacer.gif both in standalone an inside Drupal mode 
     only if you copy /images directory to Drupal directory.
     
     Do not forget to add a line 
     
     Disallow: /images/

   X In the Drupal page
  
     Set other settings and Save configuration.
            
  6) Ensure that corresponding profile.module fields exist.
     If necessary create profile.module fields that match with
     phpBB profile fields.

  7) Navigate to Blocks.
     Enable phpBBforum: Hidden authentication block.
     Configure its visibility settings

     Show block on specific pages:
     * Show on every page except the listed pages.

    Reset will help to remove the page title if you disable it back.

    4. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Menus >> Primary links
    Enter Menu item phpbbforum.

    Main page and link to phpBB in page is

    phpbbforum

    To change this name you may add URL aliases.
    
    Add next URL aliases (System path -> URL Alias)
    
    For the path 'forums'
    
    phpbbforum -> forums
    phpbbforum/index.php -> forums/index.php
    phpbbforum/viewtopic.php -> forums/viewtopic.php
    phpbbforum/viewforum.php -> forums/viewforum.php
    phpbbforum/viewonline.php -> forums/viewonline.php
    phpbbforum/memberlist.php -> forums/memberlist.php  
    phpbbforum/posting.php -> forums/posting.php
    phpbbforum/search.php -> forums/search.php
    phpbbforum/ucp.php -> forums/ucp.php
    phpbbforum/mcp.php -> forums/mcp.php
    phpbbforum/faq.php -> forums/faq.php
    phpbbforum/report.php -> forums/report.php
    phpbbforum/adm/index.php -> forums/adm/index.php
    
    Administer >> Site building >> URL aliases >> Add alias
    
    Existing system path: http://example.com/phpbbforum
    
    Specify the existing path you wish to alias. For example: node/28, forum/1, taxonomy/term/1+2.

    http://example.com/forums

    Specify an alternative path by which this data can be accessed. 
    For example, type "about" when writing an about page. 
    Use a relative path and don't add a trailing slash or the URL alias won't work.
    
    All links from blocks will have that path 'forums' instead of system phpbbforum.
    
    It works with or without Clean URLs enabled.
  
  9) To setup content submission to phpBB forum

    1. Go to Content types > Edit your content type
      
      Set in section phpBBforum submission settings
      
      Drupal to phpBB submission:
      ( ) Disabled
      (*) Enabled
      
    2. (Drupal 6 only) To enable phpBB comments in the node, set Display below the post in the setting:
      
      Location of phpBB topic comments:
      ( ) Display only on the phpBBforum page
      (*) Display below the post
        
      If you want to display both Drupal and phpBB comments, you should change the setting:
      
      Display Drupal comments:
      (*) Display only phpBB comments
      ( ) Display both Drupal and phpBB comments

    3. (Drupal 6 only) To display the phpBB topic comments in the node,
      you should insert in your theme in node-your_content_type.tpl.php these lines
    
      <?php if ($phpbbforum_comments): ?>
        <div id="phpbbforum-node-comments"><?php print $phpbbforum_comments; ?></div>
      <?php endif; ?>
      
      For the Garland theme you can use the example file garland.node-story.tpl.php.
      Rename it to node-story.tpl.php and copy to the themes/garland directory.
  
4. Theming  
  
  You should realize that on phpbbforum page there will be css conflicts 
  between Drupal and phpBB css files.
  The module is not responsible for that. You will have to resolve the css issues yourself.
  
  For the theming of the phpbbforum page the module provides:

  1) two starter phpBB styles:
  
    prosilver-embed
    subsilver2-embed
    
  2) file phpbbforum.css
  
  3) default starter css files for your drupal theme for phpBB styles:
  
    garland-phpbbforum-prosilver.css
    garland-phpbbforum-subsilver2.css

    bartik-phpbbforum-prosilver.css   (Drupal 7 only)
    bartik-phpbbforum-subsilver2.css  (Drupal 7 only)
    
    phpbbforum-prosilver.css
    phpbbforum-subsilver2.css
    
    You can copy this files to the drupal theme directory and customize them individually for the pariticular theme.
    In this case these default css files is not used.  
    
  4) file phpbbforum.theme.custom-sample.inc and two functions in it
  
    phpbbforum_set_style_example_embed
    phpbbforum_style_example_embed
    
    If you use your own phpBB style then:
    
    a) rename phpbbforum.theme.custom-sample.inc to phpbbforum.theme.custom.inc

    b) Replace 'example' with the name of your phpBB theme
    
    c) uncomment the suggested lines according your theme origin (prosilver or subsilver2)
    or write your own code.
  
    If you do not provide these function the module analyzes style name.
    If your phpBB style is created from prosilver and its name contains string "prosilver" 
    or starts with "pro" the module treats this style as prosilver.
    In other cases the module treats this style as subsilver2.
    In these cases you do not need to create and edit these functions.
    
  The styles prosilver-embed and subsilver2-embed are used only running phpBB inside Drupal page.
  The phpBB administrators or phpBB users should select only original styles prosilver or subsilver2.
  If you have your own custom style example, you should provide the style example-embed (or example_embed) 
  and it should be active in order to run inside Drupal.
  
5. Miscellaneous
  
  Need to set manually define('PHPBB_SEO_TOOLKIT', 1); in phpbb_api.php if you use this modification of phpBB3.

6. Hints  

  Your phpBB forum should be installed in subdirectory of Drupal installation directory 
  in order to run inside Drupal page. 
  For example, it is /phpBB3. But you may use your own name, but not /phpbbforum.
    
  Do not think that the embedded inside Drupal phpBB will work for your themes right out of the box.

  Install first locally and ensure that with your settings it works as you expect.

  Setting up the module for the first time use Garland (Bartik) in Drupal and prosilver in phpBB themes 
  instead of your custom themes.

  Do not use exotic layout you will never use on the production site just to test the module.

  Do not use symlinks to phpBB root if you use "In the Drupal page" mode.

  Do not use domain name with localhost http://localhost.example.com.
  
  Start learning and testing the module with layout that is similiar to your layout on production site.

  Use at you risk on production site.
