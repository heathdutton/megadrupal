External Link Popularity Installation
----------------------------------------

1) Unpack the module in the "modules" directory of your drupal installation.

2) This module requires the excellent Votingapi module to be installed as well.
   The Views module is not required but can be used to display lists of nodes
   ordered by their external link popularity. Views is also used to show several
   administrative report screens, and the Google Chart API (chart) module can
   be used to display a pie chart of most popular nodes, according to external
   link popularity.

3) Enable the External Link Popularity block by navigating to:
     Administer > Site building > Blocks

4) Configure your module by going to:
     Administer > Site configuration > External Link Popularity settings.

5) Set the "record external click" permission for the roles that you want the
   module to track at:
     Administer > User management > Permissions

6) NOTE: in order for the pop_links javascript to accurately track which nodes
   contain the external hyperlinks, your page HTML must contain <div> elements
   like this: <div id="node-1234" class="node"> (containing both the class=node
   and the id=node-NNN). Garland does this by default, but you can include this
   in your own theme by adding a link like this to your node.tpl.php:

     <div id="node-<?php print $node->nid; ?>" class="node">

     </div>

   See Garland's node.tpl.php for example.
