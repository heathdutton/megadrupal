  Popular Links uses the Voting API module to rank nodes that
  contain external links.  Nodes are awarded points when users follow any
  external link in the node.  These points can be given a lifetime to limit
  the scope of the rankings: e.g. most popular today, weekly, etc.  Each
  user click is counted only once per voting period per node.  The module
  also provides a block showing the top 10 most popular nodes.

  Enjoy,
