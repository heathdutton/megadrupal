Usage
=====

This module provides support for Entity Translation module.

Users can filter entities by entity translation language (after adding
relationship to that translation) or by filtering by language of any
translatable field.

If you want to use mechanism of blocking translations then don't forget to add
"blocking" filter after adding relationship to entity translation.
