 *  - A new account has been created.
 *  - A new subscription has been created for an account.
 *  - A subscription is canceled/terminated.
 *  - A subscription has its plan changed.
 *  - A subscription has been invoiced.
 *
 * @param $subdomain
 *   The Recurly subdomain for which this notification was received.
 * @param $notification
 *   The XML Recurly notification. This is a raw SimpleXMl parsing of the
 *   notification. See https://docs.recurly.com/api/push-notifications.

/**
 * Provides full URLs to various operations to manage Recurly subscriptions.
 *
 * This hook is implemented by modules that provide alternative ways to manage
 * a subscription. For example the Recurly Hosted Pages module returns URLs that
 * go to Recurly.com itself for managing a subscription, while the Recurly.js
 * module uses URLs on the Drupal site. If not using either Recurly Hosted Pages
 * or Recurly.js, other modules may want to provide custom URLs for managing
 * subscriptions.
 *
 * @param $operation
 *   A string that indicates the URL should go to a page providing the following
 *   functionality:
 *   - select_plan: A listing of plans available for purchase where the user can
 *      select a plan for sign up.
 *   - change_plan: A page where a user can change a provided subscription's
 *      plan. If a "plan_code" is specified in $context, the page should confirm
 *      the subscription's switch to that plan.
 *   - cancel: A page where a user can cancel a provided subscription.
 *   - reactivate: A page where a user can reactivate a plan that has been
 *      canceled (will not renew) but not terminated entirely.
 *   - update_billing: A page where a user can update their billing
 *      information.
 *   - subscribe: A page where a user can sign up for a given plan code by
 *      entering their credit card information.
 * @param $context
 *   An array of information that is provided to help assemable the $operation
 *   link. Properties may include:
 *   - entity: The associated entity for a subscription.
 *   - entity_type: The type (user, node, etc.) of the associated entity.
 *   - account_code: If the associated entity has a subscription, the Recurly
 *      account code.
 *   - currency: The currency code for a subscription.
 *   - subscription: The entire Recurly subscription object.
 *   - account: The entire Recurly account object.
 *   - plan_code: The plan code for an action, such as when changing a
 *      subscription plan or signing up for a new subscription.
 *   Not all properties will be available in all $operations.
 *
 * @return
 *   A string containing the full URL to that particular action. If the module
 *   does not provide a page to an action, NULL should be returned.
