CHANGELOG:
----------
7.x-1.x
-------
#717650 by rfay: Added tests, improved tests.

Note that the D7 port does not include the Profile token support that was 
included in 6.x. This really needs to be done outside this module so it's more
generally useful.

The [user:role_changed] is now the token that will provide which role was changed.

6.x-2.1
-------
#710210 by heltem, rfay: Fixed [role] token never interpreted. Added [role_changed] token
#671688 by rfay: Fixed localization errors.
#705298 by rfay: Fixed Incorrect check on 'token' - should be 'token_actions()'.
                 This patch also improves the admin page documentation and adds help.

6.x-2.0
-------
#587834 by rfay: Provide a trigger so that now both role add and role removal 
                 can trigger token actions.
#560852 by rfay: Add a separate permission for role_change_notify admin.
Significant code cleanup.
