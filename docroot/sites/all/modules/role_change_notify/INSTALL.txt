Installation:
-------------
1. Copy the role_change_notify.module to sites/all/modules

2. Enable the module by visiting admin/modules

3. Configure the module under administer >> config >> people >> Role Change Notify
   - Enable notifications on each desired role
   - (Optionally) Customize notification subject and text.

4. Ensure your site's "E-mail address" setting is defined, which is
   used as the "From" header for all outgoing emails. You can find the
   setting on the administer >> settings page, under the "General
   settings" set of choices. If this is not set, the user status
   module will not be able to send notification emails.

5. You should optionally install and enable the 
   - token module, http://drupal.org/project/token, which will provide many more 
     tokens for your message and much help when you're using them.
   - trigger module (with token actions module), so the module can provide a 
     trigger which fires on both role add and role remove.
