Installation intructions
========================

There are probably multiple ways this can be done. This is a
description that works for the postfix MTA. Again: If you can't
configure your MTA, this module is of no use to you.

The PEAR Mail and the Mail_mimeDecode packages are required and
expected to be in the PHP include path.

Further, you need to download the PHPmailer Bounce Mail Handler from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bmh/. Extract it and put the
phpmailer-bmh_rules.php file into the bounce_handler directory.


Now for the mailserver configuration:

1) Make sure your emails get sent using a envelop sender that has the
   receivers address encoded, e.g. VERP.
   An easy way to do this is to change your php.ini as follows:

sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -XV -t -i -f bounces@example.com

This will tell the MTA to use VERP (-XV) and to use the address
bounces@example.com as the envelope from. All conforming MTAs should
thus send bounces to bounces@example.com in the form
bounces+foo=example.com@example.com where foo=example.com is the
encoded receiver's address (foo@example.com).


2) Set up your MTA to pass received mail for bounces@example.com to
drush. This can be done in a variety of ways.
For postfix, you can define a custom transport in master.cf as:

drupal    unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=DRhu user=www-data argv=/path/to/drush -r /path/to/drupal_root bounce ${sender} ${recipient}

The user parameter should be chosen so that it matches the user your
webserver runs under.

In /etc/postfix/transport you can then define:

bounces@example.com drupal:

as the transport for your bounce address. Don't forget to run postmap.
