Intro

Basic cart is a very simple shopping cart / checkout process for Drupal,
that just sends 2 emails after each order. Along with the shopping cart,
this module also provides a block where you can view your cart's content.

It's ideal for small websites with only a few products or other content types
being sold, for example touristic offers.

Main difference from Ubercart and Commerce

The main difference from Ubercart and Commerce is the possibility of choosing
the content types that can be added to the cart. It also doesn't bother you
with the Product SKU, that can be a pain when you have just a few products.

Features

* The possibility of choosing the content types that can be added to the cart.
* The possibility of sending, or not, an email to the customer once an order is placed.
* Custom email messages for both the site administrator and the customer, along with the order details.
* A block with the contents of your shopping cart.
