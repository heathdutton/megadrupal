Security Check

This is a drush plugin for running security checks against Drupal sites.

These are basic sanity checks, they aren't intended to replace more thorough reviews of a site build.  The tests are designed to stop a badly misconfigured site going live.

To run this against a site, simply run "drush secchk" from the docroot or using a site alias.
