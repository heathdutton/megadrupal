This module shows images as dummy images. If you are working on localhost or a
dev server you do not have all the images from the production server - this is
the module for you.

To install, enable the module and go to admin/config/development/dummyimage and
configure in which cases you want dummy images to be used. You can also adjust
dummy image appearances there.

This module gives you the choice between these 4 placeholder image services:

The awesome dummy image generator service made by:
Russell Heimlich (@kingkool68)
http://dummyimage.com/

The fabulous placekitten.com service that will make your site full of cute
Kittehs.

The great http://lorempixum.com - gives you random images from categories you
choose.

The cool http://flickholdr.com that lets you choose tags from flickr and have
random images pulled in from there. The tag defaults to tapir of course.
