It was pointed out to me that a readme file would be useful for the module, so here it is!

Once you have installed simple_page_title, to make use of the module, go to the admin > structure section and you will see an option for Simple Page Title. From here, you will be presented with the screen that will allow you to add, edit and delete your page titles.

In a future version I want to tie this functionality into the node/add and node/edit screens to make it a better user experience, so watch this space for that.

I will update this file with any extra information users ask for or anything else that I think is relevant as the time goes by.

Thanks,
