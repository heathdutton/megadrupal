Description

Adds swipe gesture support to the well known Colorbox module for mobiles. Just swipe left or right on galeries to show the previous or next element!
Dependencies:

    Colorbox
    Libraries API Module
    jQuery 1.7+ (provided by jQuery Update) Please do not forget to check & select the version in the jQuery Update Module after install!

Installation:

    Download and enable this module.
    Download jquery.event.move and jquery.event.swipe from the project page (http://stephband.info/jquery.event.swipe/) and extract them as separate folders to sites/{all}/libraries/ (folder names: "jquery.event.swipe" and "jquery.event.move".
    Enable jQuery 1.7 (or higher) in jQuery Update settings ("admin/config/development/jquery_update"). Notice: In our tests 1.7 worked with fewest problems. 1.8 and others are also possible. BUT: Please check if there are bad side effects in your environment!
    If it makes sense for you, DISABLE the mobile detection in the Colorbox Settings (admin/config/media/colorbox). Else colorbox is not used on small mobile devices and this plugin is also NOT used.

Note: If you use Lightbox2, this might be your module: https://www.drupal.org/project/lightbox2_swipe
