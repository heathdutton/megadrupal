reStructuredText filter module
==============================

Provides reStructuredText filter integration for Drupal input formats. The
reStructuredText syntax is designed to co-exist with HTML, so you can set up
input formats with both HTML and reStructuredText support. It is also meant to
be as human-readable as possible when left as "source".

reStructuredText may conflict with other input filters, depending on the order
in which filters are configured to apply.
