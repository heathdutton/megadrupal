state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-10
-------------------------
* Fixed cookie bug in state_init(); string concatenation using plus instead of dot.
* Fixed undefined var $_SESSION bug (when getting/removing session var and session wasn't started).
* Cookie increase/get/remove functions/methods are now aware of cookies set/removed previously in same request (normally you cannot 'see' a cookie set in same request, only in a later request).
* Fixed documentation of state_cookie_set/State::cookieSet() - they _can_ set cookies to other paths than base_path.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-07
-------------------------
* Settings page layout and wording.
* state_set_message(); set message that survives session destruction (like user logout).

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-2.2.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-04
-------------------------
* Settings page layout.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-03
-------------------------
* Added admin user 1 to default roles getting user-activity conditioned prolongation.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-09-01
-------------------------
* Implemented pseudo role (-3) for admin user 1; previously that user could only be targeted by the authenticated user role.


state 7.x-2.x, 2013-07-17
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-2.1.


state 7.x-2.x, 2013-07-17
-------------------------
* Fixed bug that made it impossible to configure the module if the site has no administrative role (but only uses admin user 1).
* Code formatting (excessive indentation) and some phpDoc and jsDoc errors corrected.
* Removed deprecated functions and methods, because nobody uses them anymore (they got deprecated by version 1.3, and nobody uses <2.0).


state 7.x-2.x, 2013-04-21
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-2.0.


state 7.x-2.x, 2013-04-21
-------------------------
* Session server life now defaults to 1800 seconds (not only in settings page but also when frontend session control is active), if the ini setting doesnt make sense and the overrider setting is empty.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-04-20
-------------------------
* Frontend shan't err on 403 ajax response.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-04-06
-------------------------
* Detecting whether current request is a page request state_is_page_request()/State::isPageRequest() no longer requires that request counting is enabled.
* state_session_destroy()/State::sessionDestroy() now logs using category 'user', and now has parameter for logging the log out reason.
* Eliminated session server lifetime dependency, by adding an overriding setting.
* Implemented 'enforce session timeout for logged in users' option, to amend the general (non-State specific) disadvantage of non-zero cookie lifetime.
* Fixed bug in frontend script; failed to set check interval to maximally a fifth of session timeout when check interval setting was larger than session timeout.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-04-05
-------------------------
* Eliminated session cookie lifetime dependency - because there is no such dependency.
* Circumvented session server life (session.gc_maxlifetime) by introducing new optional overriding setting.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-03-16
-------------------------
* Eliminated Inspect module dependency.
* Added readme.

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-03-11
-------------------------
* Elaborate documentation of http vars checking in state_ajax_callback(), and the response var 'action' is now check_plain()'ed; both in response to a security issue which was raised because someone didn't understand the var filtering regime of state_ajax_callback().

state 7.x-2.x, 2013-02-10
-------------------------
* Documentation.


state 7.x-1.3, 2013-02-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-1.3.x as 7.x-1.3.


state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-02-10
---------------------------
* Prepared for release.

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-26
---------------------------
* Removed delete option from backend cookieRemove(), and reordered sequence of functions and methods.
* Secured frontend cookieSet() against undefined|null value argument (now becomes empty string).
* Code formatting and minification.

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-23
---------------------------
* Renamed state_destroy() to state_session_destroy, and State::destroy() to State::sessionDestroy().

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-22
---------------------------
* Reverted to use hook_init() implementation instead of hook_boot(), because too risky; too much unavailable or uninitialized stuff. Set module weight to -999 instead.
* Cookie methods can now only work with namespaced cookies, and stick more restrictively to defaults.

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-21
---------------------------
* Created frontend cookie methods.

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-20
---------------------------
* Frontend now uses correct cookie domain and path when setting cookies.
* Implemented namespaced cookie names to prevent collisions between sites that have similar cookie domains (one being a subset of the other).
* Now uses hook_boot() implementation instead of hook_init(), because session and cookie methods should be available to other modules during at hook_init().

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-13
---------------------------
* Settings page now uses API constants DRUPAL_ANONYMOUS_RID and DRUPAL_AUTHENTICATED_RID to detect anonymous and authenticated roles.

state 7.x-1.3.x, 2013-01-02
---------------------------

state 7.x-1.2.x, 2012-10-13
---------------------------

state 7.x-1.1, 2012-10-13
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-1.1.x as 7.x-1.1.


state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-10-13
---------------------------
* Fixed frontend Inspect checks (ask inspect.tcepsnI === true, not simply inspect.tcepsnI).

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-10-03
---------------------------
* Fixed wrong regex for removing url hash (failed to remove # having no value).

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-10-02
---------------------------
* Frontend now removes hash from current url, when creating reload url (because going to or redirecting to current url including hash has no effect at all ;-).

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-10-01
---------------------------
* Translation stuff.

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-09-29
---------------------------

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-09-23
---------------------------
* Renamed ::frontendSessionControl() to ::prolongation; the old method now deprecated and logs error.
* Fixed that frontend should set .prolong to 1 when actually 1, not set it to zero.
* Implemented code documentation on admin page.

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-09-22
---------------------------
* Redirection target and whether to auto-redirect are now separate settings.
* Now uses role ids instead of role names.
* Roles must be re-configured when updating to this version.

state 7.x-1.1.x, 2012-09-18

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-1.0.x as 7.x-1.0.


state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-16
---------------------------
* Fixed various syntactic/code format issues (Code Review).
* Changed watchdog call, to prevent error when extracting strings for translation - we do NOT want the messages translated here.
* Fixed frontend t() being called prematurely (before translations .js file had been loaded).
* Added translation to Danish.
* Renamed state_session_destroy() to state_destroy().

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-09
---------------------------
* Backend AJAX callback now requires live session.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-07
---------------------------
* Frontend shant call backend destroy() unless session id hash cookie matches the page's session id.
* Backend must match it's current session id against frontend's page session id, before destroying.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-04
---------------------------
* Check interval regulation no longer dependent on prolongation (was plain wrong).
* Next checkInterval is now being reduced to half, when closing in to an expiration.
* Frontend now subtracts full check interval from session timeout, to minimize the risk of acting too late (timeout may fall between checks.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-03
---------------------------
* Backend destroy() now deletes frontend State related cookies prior to destroying login and session.
* Frontend now subtracts half of check interval from session timeout, to minimize the risk of acting too late (timeout may fall between checks).

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-02
---------------------------
* Frontend ensures that the interval is maximally 20% of the session timeout; otherwise session warning info may never be displayed.
* Session may now be 'revived' after session warning, when conditional prolongation.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-09-01
---------------------------
* Frontend State is now included at every page, minified, via .info.
* Frontend State always gets initialized, even when no checking/prolongation.
* Frontend State inline initialization moved to header section.
* State now destroys a session when it expires.
* Frontend refactored.
* Fixed bug (omission) in frontend, which effectively made it unaware of other windows/tabs session prolongation (didnt update session expire time).

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-08-25
---------------------------
* Replaced call to InspectTrc::log() with inspect_trace(), to prevent Inspect module version clash.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-25
---------------------------
* Frontend: renamed some _state properties and added sessionProlonged as property to _state; both for better reviewing (via State.inspect()).
* Changed session/form expiration warning time to 90% instead 80% of expiration; warnings popped way too early.
* Backend: hook implementation that includes Javascript now implements hook_preprocess_html (instead of hook_preprocess).

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-24
---------------------------
* Fixed jsdoc comments, for jsdoc parser.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-23
---------------------------
* Got rid of JSON encoded frontend settings.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-21
---------------------------
* Frontend now automatically registers all successful (jQuery) AJAX requests, and take them into account when estimating last session timeout renewal.
* Implemented wildcard role.
* Frontend's prolong setting now has the same values as backend ditto; 2 ~ visitor based, 3 ~ unconditional.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-15
---------------------------
* Combined frontend setting into single JSON var.
* Tuned info box, and wrote help section for settings page.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-12
---------------------------
* Session var getters and setters work again, having more logical and flexible parameter signatures.
* Shortened persistent variable names somewhat, combining them into less vars is just too complicated.
* Implemented page response counting, and page response number as GET arg to AJAX requests (to facilitate behaviour inspection in access logs).

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-11
---------------------------
* Will create new session var methods and functions, with arguments that wont motivate applying (call_user_func_array()).

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-10
---------------------------
* Always add javascript file, to get it preprocessed.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-07-01

---------------------------
* Frontend session prolongation done, except for out-session behaviours and custom messages.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-05-28
---------------------------
* Added option for checking if session is current (at frontend), when current visitor isnt supposed to get session prolongation.
* Frontend done, except for ajax_token, and _info() (using jQuery.ui).
* Backend done, except for always adding state.js, and always provide ajax_token support (getter).
* Reorganised backend, and integrated ajax_token into frontend.
* Next: figure out how to avoid that all open tabs make prolonging AJAX request uncoordinated, and integrate ui.dialog, and consider making ajax_token per page.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-05-27
---------------------------
* Page request counting done.
* Backend part of prolongiation fairly done, working on frontend equiv.

state 7.x-1.0.x, 2012-05-17
