State 7.x-1.1


New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
 * Redirection target and whether to auto-redirect are now separate settings.
 * Now uses role ids instead of role names.
 * Added translations (only messages to user) for Swedish, Danish and Finnish.
 * Implemented code documentation on admin page.
Frontend (Javascript)
 * Frontend State is now also available as Drupal.State.

Bug fixes
---------
Frontend (Javascript)
 * IE<9 XMLHttpRequest object has no hasOwnProperty method.
 * Fixed Inspect checks (ask inspect.tcepsnI === true, not simply inspect.tcepsnI).
 * Frontend now removes hash from current url, when creating reload url (because going to or redirecting to current url including hash has no effect at all ;-).
 * Fixed that frontend should set .prolong to 1 when actually 1, not set it to zero.

Install/update notes
--------------------
 * Roles must be re-configured when updating to this version.
 * Clear all cache.
