State 7.x-2

The main issue of this release is more tolerant (forgiving) configuration
Frontend session control no longer requires non-default session settings in the site's settings.php file.
And State no longer depends on (requires) the Inspect module.

New features
------------
Backend
 * 'Enforce session timeout for logged in users', which logs a user out if he/she returns with a session cookie that really should have timed out.
 * 'Override session life on server' which effectively overrides the PHP ini setting session.gc_maxlifetime.
 * Checking whether current request is a page request no longer requires that request counting is enabled.

Bug fixes
---------
Frontend (Javascript)
 * Fixed bug in frontend script; failed to set check interval to maximally a fifth of session timeout when check interval setting was larger than session timeout.

Install/update notes
--------------------
 * Clear all cache
