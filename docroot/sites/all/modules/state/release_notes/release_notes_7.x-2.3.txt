State 7.x-2.3


New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
* state_set_message(); set message that survives session destruction (like user logout).
* Cookie increase/get/remove functions/methods are now aware of cookies set/removed previously in same request (normally you cannot 'see' a cookie set in same request, only in a later request).

Bug fixes
---------
Backend (PHP)
* Fixed undefined var $_SESSION bug (when getting/removing session var and session wasn't started).
* Fixed cookie bug in state_init(); string concatenation using plus instead of dot.

Install/update notes
--------------------
* No actions required.
