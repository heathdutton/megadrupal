Prevent cookie domain collisions
This release introduces functions/methods - PHP as well as Javascript - for working safe and easily with cookies.
Cookie collisions occur when two sites have same or similar base cookie domain; example:
If the cookie domain of site B is .sub.domain.tld, and that of site A is .domain.tld (a subset of B's domain),
then site B will read cookies set for site A.
