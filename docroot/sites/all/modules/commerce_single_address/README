Provides an alternative to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_addressbook">Commerce Addressbook</a>
for sites where customers should only have one valid customer profile of a given type.
For example, a site selling downloads, where the customer always has one active
billing profile.
The current profile is shown rendered, with an edit button for switching back
to the regular edit form.

Notes:
- Removes the checkbox for copying from a source profile ("My shipping profile is the same as my billing profile")
