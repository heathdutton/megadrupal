Attention!

This module is not production-ready, it will break google analytics on any pages for which it is enabled, just for a start.

To Do:

* Enable configuration of blacklist/whitelist functionality and allow end users to configure specific links.
* Document how to make ga work.
* etc...

Installation:

1. Download the library from http://instantclick.io/start.html and place in sites/all/libraries/instantclick
2. Go to /admin/config/development/instantclick and enable one or both of front end or administrative pages.

Known incompatibilities:

* The ckeditor module is not compatible. Current workaround is to add node/add/* to the blacklist.
