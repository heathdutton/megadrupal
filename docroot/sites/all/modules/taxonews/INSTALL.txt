OSInet TAXONEWS module for Drupal
=================================

UNSTABLE VERSION for Drupal 7 UNSTABLE 7

Caveat Emptor: everything in this branch is likely to change before Drupal 7 is 
actually released. It is currently NOT fit for any need except core 7 testing.

PREREQUISITES
=============

  - Drupal 7.0 UNSTABLE-11
  - PHP 5.1
  - MySQL 5.x

INSTALLING
==========

1. Copy this directory to
  <drupal>/sites/all/modules/taxonews

2. If you want to use the french version, make sure locale.module is loaded
   in admin/modules. Drupal will then auto-load the translation.

3. To create a new vocabulary for taxonews use (skip otherwise)
3.1 browse to admin/structure/taxonomy/add and define a vocabulary for your news
3.2 add terms to your new vocabulary

4. To create news blocks with taxonews
4.1 Browse to admin/structure/taxonews
4.2 Select the vocabulary based on which taxonews will create blocks.
    Remember, one block will be defined for each term in the vocabulary.
4.3 Define the maximum age, in days, for nodes to be considered as news
    included in taxonews blocks
4.4 Browse to admin/structure/block
4.5 You'll notice a set of blocks named:
      taxonews/<vocabulary name>/<a term in the vocabulary you chose>
4.5.1 If you don't see these blocks, browse to
      admin/config/development/performance, and click "Clear all caches"
4.6 Activate them like any other drupal block.

5. To theme blocks
5.1 For plain PHP themes, define <your_theme>_taxonews_block_view()
    and look at the code for theme_taxonews_block_view to see what
    your options are.
5.2 For PHPtemplate themes, see http://drupal.org/node/11811 and redefine
    theme_taxonews_block_view()
5.3 For simple CSS customizations, themeability is defined to the read-more class,
    the list styles (theme_item_list) and RSS icon styles (theme_feed_icon())


UPGRADING FROM DRUPAL 4.6/4.7/5/6 BRANCHES
==========================================

Since the module does not store any content except its parameters,
and did not change them from the earlier branches, you can just erase
the files from the previous version and copy the files of the new version.
No additional install or update.php procedure is currently necessary.


UNINSTALLING
============

The module supports the uninstall functions available since Drupal 6.

1. disable the module from admin/build/modules
2. click on "uninstall" on the same page once the module has been disabled,
   and confirm

If you just remove the module files without uninstalling, the configuration
variables will remain in the drupal 'variables' table, where a later install
can find them again, and possibly uninstall them cleanly if you choose to
perform an uninstall.
