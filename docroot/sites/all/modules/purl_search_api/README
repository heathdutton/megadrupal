To use this module, you need 2 views that are based on a search_api index. Both use 
the same (or a subset) of facets.

On the admin PURL types page admin/config/search/purl/types enable the Search_API type

Then on the PURL admin page admin/config/search/purl check the views that you want to 
persist your search_api facets for.

Thats pretty much it.
