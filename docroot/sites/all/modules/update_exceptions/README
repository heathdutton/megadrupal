Drupal 7 has a nice and comfortable feature of looking for upgrades for all installed modules, warning about new 
releases. However, in some special cases (notably, for custom modules developed in-house) there is no place Drupal could 
visit to learn about upgrades and new versions, consequently, the upgrade report page will be cluttered with not 
available warnings.

The system has partly catered for this by introducing the project status url entry in the module .info file (see 
http://drupal.org/node/542202). However, unless you have something at the URL specified that can report the module 
status, you will continue to see error messages in the report page.

This very simple module offers a solution to this. By introducing a common URL for all similar modules on a site 
(http://www.example.com/projects/[module]/[core]), it is able to provide a kind of a fake report to Drupal for all these 
modules, always reporting back that they are completely up-to-date. Simply use this link in your .info file, eg:

  project status url = http://www.example.com/projects

and the module will always report as up-to-date.

**********
Only use this module to suppress upgrade warnings about other modules you have complete authority over and you can make 
sure they are really upgraded as needed. Never disable the upgrade status report of modules that should be duly 
monitored for bugfixes and other reports.
