it with git version control software.

### Install drush

We follow the DevelClub guide (es) http://www.develclub.es/drupal/tutorial-de-instalacion-de-drupal-7-en-espanol-usando-drush.html

Install drush:

    
    sudo pear install drush/drush 
    

Check status:

    
    drush status
    

Library error:

    
    Drush needs to download a library from                               [error]
    http://download.pear.php.net/package/Console_Table-1.1.3.tgz in order
    to function, and the attempt to download this file automatically
    failed because you do not have permission to write to the library
    directory /usr/share/php/drush/lib. To continue you will need to
    manually download the package from
    http://download.pear.php.net/package/Console_Table-1.1.3.tgz, extract
    it, and copy the directory into your /usr/share/php/drush/lib
    directory.
    

How we solve it. We get the library:

    
    wget http://download.pear.php.net/package/Console_Table-1.1.3.tgz
    

Unzip:

    
    file-roller Console_Table-1.1.3.tgz 
    

Move to the local library directory: (typical Linux example; this path depends on your local environment)

    
    sudo cp -R Console_Table-1.1.3 /usr/share/php/drush/lib/
    

We clean:

    
    rm -fr Console_Table-1.1.3*
    rm package.xml
    

Check status again with drush: This shows it can determine the config files for PHP including
command line PHP-CLI.

    
    $drush status
    
    PHP executable        :  /usr/bin/php          
    PHP configuration     :  /etc/php5/cli/php.ini 
    PHP OS                :  Linux                 
    Drush version         :  6.2.0                 
    Drush configuration   :                        
    Drush alias files     :                
    

### Install Drupal with drush

To create Drupal instance, we put ourselves in the directory on the server and execute:

    
    $drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=drupaltest
    Project drupal (7.31) downloaded to /home/eduardo/SERVIDOR/drupaldev/drupaldev.                 [success]
    Project drupal contains:                                                                        [success]
     - 3 profiles: minimal, standard, testing
     - 4 themes: stark, garland, bartik, seven
     - 47 modules: tracker, simpletest, update, book, image, contextual, openid, forum, shortcut, aggregator, system, text, list, field_sql_storage, number,
    options, field, color, filter, toolbar, rdf, node, comment, contact, menu, overlay, locale, blog, syslog, file, block, dashboard, path, statistics, taxonomy,
    dblog, php, translation, user, profile, help, poll, search, trigger, field_ui, drupal_system_listing_compatible_test, drupal_system_listing_incompatible_test
    

We have made the installation in 10 seconds.

We get translations: This covers Spanish (ES) and Catalan (CA).

    
    $wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/translations/7.x/drupal/drupal-7.34.ca.po
    $wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/translations/7.x/drupal/drupal-7.34.es.po


Move the translations to your directory:

    
    $mv  *.po profiles/standard/translations/
    

Complete the installation with passwords and admin account name:

    
    drush site-install standard --account-name=integraledu --account-pass=TU_PASSWORD --db-url=mysql://root:TU_PASSWORD_MYSQL@localhost/drupaldev --locale=ca
    

It only creates the database and everything you need.

You just need to add write permission for the server's UNIX user to `sites/default/files/` 
for correct file upload handling.

### Installing ces module for development

Follow the Drupal instructions with the project here: https://drupal.org/project/ices/git-instructions

We get the module from git:

    
    $git clone --branch 7.x-1.x YOUR_DRUPAL_USERNAME@git.drupal.org:project/ices.git ces
    
    
    Cloning into 'ces'...
    YOUR_DRUPAL_USERNAME@git.drupal.org's password: 
    remote: Counting objects: 643, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (639/639), done.
    remote: Total 643 (delta 455), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (643/643), 211.59 KiB | 169 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (455/455), done.
    

Add our email to git configuration: This associates our Drupal user to commits correctly.

    
    $git config user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
    $git config user.name "YOUR DRUPAL USERNAME"
    

We activate the modules from drush:

    
    drush en $(for m in `find sites/all/modules/ -name '*.module'` ; do basename $m .module ; done)
    ces is already enabled.                                                                                                                                       [ok]

### Install greences theme

You are missing the theme by default, so clone it:
    

    $git clone --branch 7.x-1.x YOUR_DRUPAL_USERNAME@git.drupal.org:sandbox/esteve/1866046.git greences
    

Activate theme:
    

    $drush en greences
    

You are missing part of the base theme. Note: It's necessary to have installed the ZEN theme 
(version 7.x-5.x) which is the parent theme of greences: https://drupal.org/project/zen.

    
    $ drush dl zen
    Project zen (7.x-5.4) downloaded to sites/all/themes/zen.                  [success]
    $ drush en zen
    The following extensions will be enabled: zen
    Do you really want to continue? (y/n): y
    zen was enabled successfully.                                                   [ok]
    $ drush cc all
    'all' cache was cleared in self
    

### We activate modules

Activate the system modules

  * **Syslog**: In order to have the system logs
  * **Testing**: In order to test the application with test suites

That completes development setup. Standard development modules are also handy, for example:

  * **Devel**: Provides common development functions
  * **devel_themer**: Shows which DOM elements are rendered by functions
  * **coder**: Provides code checks and linters to help with Drupal style coding
