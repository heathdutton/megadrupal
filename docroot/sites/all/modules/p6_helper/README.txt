This is a helper module for p6_base and its sub-themes, mostly.

It creates two new blocks and assigns them to the footer region.

First block, "Copyright statement" has settings for including a copyright
statement with a dynamic year, and footer menu (created by the module during
install), and additional textarea field for footer message.

Second block, "created by project6" displays the logo of Project6 Design.
Supports settings for aligning to left, right or center on either dark or light
background color.
