Drush Remake
============

This project provides a Drush command that can 'remake' and installation
profile. If you want to 'remake' the entire Drupal site, then just use Drush
make itself!

Installation
------------

Drush can install this extension for you:

    drush dl drush_remake

Alternatively you can install this code like any other Drush extension, into
somewhere like:

    ~/.drush/drush_remake/

or:

    /usr/share/drush/commmands/drush_remake/

Usage
-----

From somewhere within the Drupal root of your site run the following:

    drush remake

This will roughly do the following, determine the correct install profile to
remake, or give you a choice. Then it will:

1. 'cd' into the profile directory for your selected profile.
2. Run Drush make with the following arguments and options:
  - --no-core
  - --working-copy
  - --contrib-destination=.
  - [path to make file]
  - [a dot]

Advanced usage
--------------

You can also pass along the --projects option to Drush to only remake certain
projects, like this:

    drush remake --projects=views,ctools
