Upgrading project modules from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7
===================================================

The D6 to D7 upgrade of project has some requirements you need to fulfill.

Required modules:
- advanced_help (optional)
- ctools
- entity
- entityreference
- field_collection
- link
- machine_name
- project
- project_release
- views
- views_ui

Project usage module:
- flot
- libraries

Images attached to projects:
- image_legacy (7.x-1.x-dev), https://www.drupal.org/project/image
- image_attach, https://www.drupal.org/project/image_attach
- inline_entity_form
- field_convert

To run the upgrade somewhat smooth it is recommended to remove all files from
"sites/all/modules" and run the Drupal Core 7 upgrade first. Than enable all
above modules via Drush or Web interface and rerun update.php. If you keep the
contrib modules in the "sites/all/modules" you run into dependency issues in
update.php you cannot solve as the required modules are not getting enabled
automatically.


Required steps:
===============

1. Upgrade Drupal Core from D6 to D7 the normal way

2. Enable modules with Drush:
2.1 drush dl advanced_help ctools entity entityreference field_collection flot libraries link machine_name project project_release project_usage views views_ui
2.2 drush en advanced_help ctools entity entityreference field_collection flot libraries link machine_name project project_release project_usage views views_ui

3. If image module has been used to attach image nodes to project nodes:
3.1 Run "drush -y en field_convert image_legacy"
3.2 Go to admin/content/field_convert
3.3 Ignore bug - Notice: Array to string conversion in _field_convert_batch
3.4 drush -y pm-disable field_convert
3.5 drush -y pm-uninstall field_convert
3.6 drush -y pm-disable image_legacy
3.6 drush -y pm-uninstall image_legacy
3.7 rm -R "sites/all/modules/image"
3.8 rm -R "sites/all/modules/field_convert"
3.9 drush dl image_attach inline_entity_form
