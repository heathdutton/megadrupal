Collaboration tools and project management for Drupal sites.

This suite of modules is the heart of the collaboration tools and
release management for Drupal.org itself.

Projects can have issue tracking associated with them by enabling
the project_issue module (https://drupal.org/project/project_issue).

Projects can have releases associated with them, and this module
provides various ways to search for projects and download specific
releases.

Integration with various revision control systems is available through
the Version Control API (https://drupal.org/project/versioncontrol)

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt.

For instructions when upgrading to newer versions, see UPGRADE.txt.

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project.

The project family of modules is currently co-maintained by:
