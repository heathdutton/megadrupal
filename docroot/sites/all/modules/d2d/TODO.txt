- separate db queries from includes/d2d.requests.inc, rewrite MySQL queries
- example: add check to only show in menu if initialization is complete
- wrap all drupal_get_variable and similar method calls in own method
- d2d_patterns: should not make use of variable_get directly but use api!
- d2d_patterns seems to have some bugs
- rename methods and for the moment add old method calls in d2d.deprecated.inc
- check d2d tests, in particular permissions
- db queries / access in installation file -> api?
- make sure db is clean on deinstallation, clean all variables set before
