/**
 * If you put your custom CSS here it will be: - rewritten if it contains
 * Drupal variables - applied after all module and theme CSS giving it the
 * highest priority.
 *
 * The CSS values that are wrapped in '/*variable' comments are intended for
 * use by https://www.drupal.org/project/style_settings. Enable that module
 * and include those CSS variables in a settings form. This is in fact an
 * ideal way to give a webmaster limited and validated control over a site's
 * styling through a UI.
