If you upgrade from the 7.x-1.0 version you should add to the '.info' file of
your active theme:

soft_dependencies[] = style_settings

This way stylesheets that were rewritten before, continue to be rewritten also
with the upgraded module. However the new version omits CSS files that do not
contain any theme settings or variable comments as this is and was unnecessary.

You have now the option to extend Style Settings to modules as well, using the
same method.
