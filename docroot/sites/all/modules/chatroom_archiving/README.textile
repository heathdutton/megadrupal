h1. Chatroom Archiving

Chatroom Archiving provides integration between "Node.js Chatroom":http://drupal.org/project/chatroom and "Rules":http://drupal.org/project/rules so that chat sessions can be periodically made inactive/closed (i.e. disabling chat input) as well as providing some useful formatting for displaying an archived chat. 

In order to use you'll need to have a working version of "Chatroom":http://drupal.org/project/chatroom (version 7.x-1.x). You'll then need to configure a custom Rule including scheduling to provide the parameters for when and how you want to archive certain chatroom nodes (i.e. nodes with a chatroom field). 

*NOTE:* This module is currently under development. There are obviously many possible use cases for how and when you might archive a chat session. Feel free to post your ideas, feedback, requests and patches in the issue queue.
