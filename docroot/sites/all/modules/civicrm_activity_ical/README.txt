OVERVIEW
--------

Several people have expressed interest in getting their CiviCRM assigned
activities into their Google Calendar or similar calendaring applications. This
module fills that purpose by providing a feed of each user's assigned activities
in iCalendar format, ready to be subscribed to from with Google Calendar and/or
Outlook.

KEY FEATURES
------------

* General description: Users can access an iCal feed of their upcoming (future)
  activities, suitable for subscription via Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook,
  and/or similar software.
* Activities are represented as VEVENT objects, matching applicable properties
  (DTSTART, DTEND based on duration, etc.) where possible and appending names of
  any other asignees to the DESCRIPTION property.
* Feed includes activities of any type, including client-defined activity types.
* Feed includes activities with a status of "Scheduled" or any client-defined
  activity status.
* To conserve server resources, feeds are cached at a site-wide configurable
  interval (default 30 minutes).
* A user's activities feed shows all activities having that user assigned, even
  if other users are also assigned.
* The user can easily determine the correct URL for the activities feed by
  viewing the URL in CiviCRM.
* URL includes a persistent random hash to limit other parties' attempts at
  guessing the URL and viewing the user's feed; this can be re-generated by the
  user in case, for example, the URL becomes known to the wrong people.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------

Follow the standard Drupal module installation procedure. Note that this module
requires CiviCRM.

The configuration page is available at admin/settings/civicrm_activity_ical
(http://example/admin/settings/civicrm_activity_ical).


FEED URL FOR EACH USER
----------------------

Each CiviCRM contact having a Drupal user account is assigned a unique URL to
access their feed. This URL includes a random hash as a barrier against
unauthorized persons guessing the URL and accessing the contact's feed.

Other than validating the random hash, the URL makes no checks for
authentication before presenting the activity feed for the requested contact. A
user may regenerate a new URL with a new random hash if she believes her feed
URL has become known by people who should not have it.

The user's feed URL, and tools to regenerate it, are available at
civicrm_activity_ical/settings/user
(http://example.com/civicrm_activity_ical/settings/user) when the user is
logged in.
