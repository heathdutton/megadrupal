All that is required to use the IMCE SWFUpload module is to install
and configure the SWFUpload module then enable the IMCE SWFUpload
module.

The SWFUpload module installation is relatively involved but the README
file covers the process very well. The IMCE_SWFUpload module depends
on version 2.2.0.1 of the SWFUpload utility.

This module should work with IMCE versions 1.x and 2.x
