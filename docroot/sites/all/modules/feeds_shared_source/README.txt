INTRODUCTION
------------

Provides a Feeds node processor that allows more than one Feed to update a
single node.

Feeds, by default, will treat GUIDs as unique to the Feed nid and the Feed
importer ID. This prevents different importers from updating the same node
despite them using the same GUID. This module will allow you to configure
that functionality on the node processor configuration screen.
