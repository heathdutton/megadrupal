SUMMARY
========
PrevNext (Previous/Next) is a simple module that provides, for any node type you want, 
two links to the previous and to the next node of the same type.

You can choose for what type of node you want to enable these links through a simple
configuration panel. Once you enabled the content types you want, in the
"Manage Display" of that types you'll find two new "extra fields":
one for previous and one for next link.

This module, also, supports multilingual (i18n module) automatically, basing on
the "Multilingual support" configuration of a node type.
In this way, it allows the user to browse nodes in the same language.

Moreover, for both links, you'll find separated tpl through which you can
customize the html structure, add classes and something like this.
