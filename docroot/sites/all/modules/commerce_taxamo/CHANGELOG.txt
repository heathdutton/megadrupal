=========

Version 7.x-1.2
- Changed the default order states used to precalculate taxes to remove the
Payment state.
- Added a more correct way to comunicate with Taxamo API.

only available to fix an issue with some payment processors.

that don't uses Taxamo's taxes.

- Added buyer's name and address to the transaction.
