## SUMMARY ##

This module can greatly simplify user entry of repeating dates. It supports a number of use cases as follows:

- The user enters a date which may be repeated in a number of pre-determined ways e.g. no repeat, every week, every month, every year. Up to 5 rules may be set by the administrator per field. The options may be presented as a group of radio buttons or as a select box, which also serves to clearly indicate the current repeat setting without having to expand and interpret the standard repeat rule form.

- As above, but the user is also given the option to enter a custom rule via the standard repeat rule form. The standard form is displayed only when the custom rule option is selected.

- The user enters a date which by it's nature is a repeating date (e.g. birthday, anniversary). On submission the date is automatically repeated using a repeat rule provided by the administrator.

- The user enters a date which may be a repeating date as defined by a single rule provided by the administrator. The user may select to apply the repeat rule via a simple checkbox.

## INSPIRATION ##

The following sites/apps inspired the repeat date presets module:

- Apple iCal - very slick repeat date UI - example of preset select box with custom option.
- Amazon - Your profile > Your reminders > create/edit reminder - example of optional single repeat rule.

## INSTALLATION ##
