About
=====

Product "Power Tools" for Ubercart gives the store admin a number of options
for altering the product creation form.

This is useful when you have Ubercart product types (including the default
product type and any site-specific product classes) that do not require all of
the possible product fields, especially if someone less computer savvy will be
dealing with data entry for products listed on the site.

Unneeded fields can be disabled and hidden, or preset and hidden.

Tweakable options include:

    * Auto Generate SKU
    * List Position
    * List Price, Sell Price, and Cost
    * Default Quantity & Package Quantity
    * Whether a product is shippable, other shipping fields can be preset
      and hidden, or hidden for non shippable products
    * Set default stock levels (If stock module is installed)

Usage
=====

Once installed, settings are available by product class at the URL
admin/store/products/power-tools

Power tools settings are configured for each class by clicking the edit action
next to the associated product class, and can be enabled or disabled for each
class individually. Settings for a product class may be cloned from any other
product class.
