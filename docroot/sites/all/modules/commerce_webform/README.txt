Commerce Webform

This module extends both commerce and webform. It allows the site owner to create a webforms with a new product field. The productfield allows the listing of one or more products which the site user would then select from. When the form is submitted the products are added to the users shopping cart. The webform results page shows the submitted forms and intiially marks products as unpaid. Later, when the user has paid for the products in their basket, the webform submission is updated and all products that made it to the checkout are then marked as having been paid for.
