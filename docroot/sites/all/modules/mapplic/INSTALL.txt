MAPPLIC INSTALLATION

1) Download the Mapplic Drupal module
Extract the module and copy to
sites/all/modules/mapplic

2) Pay and download
This is a paid plugin and requires a license.
Plugin website: http://www.mapplic.com/plugin/

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please make sure you purchase the jQuery version, currently for $18 (2015.07.20)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Follow the payment procedure.
After the payment you'll be able to download the plugin package.

3) Creating target folder
In your Drupal instance create a folder named:
sites/all/libraries/mapplic

4) Copying necessary library files
Extract the downloaded Mapplic package into sites/all/libraries/mapplic.
Now you should have two folders inside sites/all/libraries/mapplic a 'doc' and
an 'html' folder.

4b) If you downloaded accidentally the WordPress version instead of the
jQuery version, you'll see a different folder structure and it is a bit more
time to set up the library, but you are still good to go.
Here is what you need to do.
You'll see 'docs', 'Licensing', and 'mapplic' folders.
Copy the following folders to the library folder created before:
- mapplic/js -> sites/all/libraries/html/mapplic/
- mapplic/images -> sites/all/libraries/mapplic/html/mapplic/
- mapplic/css/*.css -> sites/all/libraries/mapplic/html/mapplic/

Enable the Drupal Mapplic module.

Now you'll have a fully working version of the Mapplic module.
Refer to the README.txt for further steps and instructions.
