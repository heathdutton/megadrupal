INTRODUCTION
------------
The First child redirect module to allow nodes to redirect to
the first child menu item if selected in the node edit form.
This is useful if you have a hub/anchor page with a range of child items
represented in a tabbed menu or accordion format where the first item
in that group should be redirected to automatically.
An example of this would be with product hub page
for a laptop with a tabbed content
representation of the different models
which all have their own pages and you would want
the user to redirect straight to the first model
within the tabbed content group.
Provided with this module is also a permission
to allow certain user roles to bypass
the redirect functionality.
