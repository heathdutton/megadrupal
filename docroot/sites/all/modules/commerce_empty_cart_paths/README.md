# About this Module

This module allows site administrators to define multiple paths, and when a
user visits a non-declared page, their shopping cart is emptied.

# Usage

* Download and enable the module.
* Go to admin/commerce/config/empty-cart-paths and enter any additional paths.
  'checkout' and 'checkout/*' are declared by default.
* That's it!
