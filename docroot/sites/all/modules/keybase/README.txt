Download and extract the module to the usual path, then enable it via the
modules page.

Make sure you have 'Administer site configuration' permission.

Run `keybase prove web http://example.com' and then visit the keybase module
configuration page at admin/config/services/keybase

Paste the generated well-known content from keybase into the settings form
