--WHAT IS IT?--
This module uses the Google Charts API to generate a QR code based on your
current URL.


--How do I use it?--
Install, and go to admin/config/system/googleqrcode to configure available settings.

Place block as desired, style as desired, set to show as you wish, and call
it a day! This is a fairly straight forward and simple module!
