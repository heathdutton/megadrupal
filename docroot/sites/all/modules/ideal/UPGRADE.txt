UPGRADING FROM iDEAL 7.x-2.x TO iDEAL 7.x-3.x
---------------------------------------------

- Download Payment 7.x-1.x from http://drupal.org/project/payment and upload it
  to your site.
- Optionally download Views 7.x-3.x (or 7.x-2.x) from
  http://drupal.org/project/views and upload it to your site.
- Put your site in maintenance mode
- Replace the module folder located at ./sites/*/modules/ideal with the iDEAL
  7.x-3.x module folder
- Run update.php (do not visit your website to do anything else, or you will
  experience errors)
- Put your site back online.

THE FOLLOWING WILL BE UPDATED
-----------------------------
- Merchant and acquirer configuration will be converted to Payment payment
  methods.
- Transactions will be converted to Payment payments.
- If available, Views UI will be enabled to mimic the iDEAL 7.x-2.x
  administration pages.

THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE UPDATED
---------------------------------

- iDEAL Administration Interface and iDEAL Donation Form do not exist in iDEAL
  7.x-3.x. They will be uninstalled and as a consequence their pages will not
  be available anymore. Payment and Views (optional) replace iDEAL
  Administration Interface and Payment Form Field replaces iDEAL Donation Form.
- iDEAL Donation Form's configuration will not be updated, because Payment does
  not support payers to enter payment amounts themselves, and because the
  equivalent payment form setup using Payment Form Field requires an entity
  that has a Payment Form field attached to it. Because of this it is hard or
  impossible (depending on the configuration) to update the iDEAL Donation Form
  configuration precisely and you will have to do that yourself.
