Business Success through Continuous Improvement

Everyday iClew checks your Drupal website and delivers the improvement 
recommendations to your in-box. All recommendations are made with the aim of 
boosting your business bottom line by driving more traffic to your website or 
turning more visitors into paying customers. Your business is unique, 
therefore each and every recommendation that iClew makes is tailor-made for 
you. 

Key to Your Success - Action!

iClew creates to-dos for you and tracks your progress closely. Are you too 
busy to work those important, but not so urgent tasks? iClew reminds you if 
you leave an action item open for over a week. If you are really busy then 
you can always postpone an item for 30 days, just with a single click from 
your in-box.  

Free Tools Included

In addition to personalized improvement recommendations, iClew provides a set 
of tools that are essential to your online success, many of which are not 
available free of charge anywhere else.

* Spell check
* Link check
* Availability alerts

REQUIREMENTS  
------------

This module does not require any modules other than the core.

This module requires an iClew account, which can be automatically created and 
connected when setting up the module. See the Configuration section below.


INSTALLATION
------------

* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.
* After enabling the module, proceed to configure it as described below.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module, even being enabled, does nothing until you set it up by 
registering your website with iClew.

* Navigate to /admin/config/iclew/account.
* Click "Sign up with iClew" button.
* Complete the registration form.

If registration is successful, the button "Sign up with iClew" on the 
configuration page is replaced with "Manage your iClew account". 

Once you complete email verification, you may start receiving improvement


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

* If you have registered the website with iClew but the button "Sign up with 
  iClew" persists on the configuration page, it means iClew server cannot
  communicate with your website. Check if you website can be   accessed 
  publicly from the Internet. This module does not work with website on your 
  local machine or a server without public access.

* If you could not complete registration because "the domain was already 
  registered before", cancel your existing iClew account and retry it.

* If you change the domain name of your website after setting up the module,
  it will stop working. You need to uninstall/reinstall it to make it work.
