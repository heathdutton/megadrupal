IMCE plupload 7.x-2.0, 2015-12-26
---------------------------------
Issue #2076099 by ram4nd: IMCE extensions set to '*'

Breaking Change: 
When updating from 1.3 to 2.0 ensure that if you relied on IMCE's file type filter set to '*' to invoke plupload's 
default filtering of 'jpg jpeg gif png txt doc xls pdf ppt pps odt ods odp' you'll have to set this filter manually. 
From 2.0 onwards, setting the file type filter to '*' will correctly allow all file-types to be uploaded.
