DESCRIPTION AND BENEFITS
------------------------

The GOLIVE Checklist module provides a list of actions that you should
take before going live. It
provides little functionality itself but rather it helps you keep track of what
needs to be done and what has been completed already.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

GOLIVE Checklist is installed in the usual way. See
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7. To start using
the module, go to admin/settings/golive-checklist. It will pre-check any
completed items it is able to auto detect. Start working through the rest, and
click "Save" to save your progress!


MORE INFORMATION
----------------


- Enjoy using the module!
