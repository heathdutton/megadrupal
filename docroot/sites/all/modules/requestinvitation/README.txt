SYNOPSIS
--------

Semi-private sites or sites that are still in beta may want to force users who
are interested in becoming a member to request an invitation first. Once a site
administrator has reviewed the requests, he/she can send out the invitations to
the requesters so that they can join the site. This module allows such a
workflow to be set up.
