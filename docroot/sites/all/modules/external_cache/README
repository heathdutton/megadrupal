External Cache
==============

This is a super simple module that allows you to control Drupal's interaction
with an external cache.

Configuration
-------------

Visit: 'admin/config/development/performance' for a new checkbox:
'Enable external page caching' and you will also want to set up the:
'reverse proxy' settings on the same page.
