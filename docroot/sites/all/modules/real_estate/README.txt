2. Then go to the Real Estate section and enable a DRE Kickstart module
    if you want use the whole DRE package.

3. Go to /real-estate-property-list

  Instead of using a Flex Slider module, can be used any other slider module.

  Instead of using the DRE SimpleGMap module, can be used more complex and
  powerful solution. Addressfield address can be automatically Geocoded into
  Geofield points for display on Openlayers Maps.
