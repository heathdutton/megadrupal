Welcome

Here is a module that converts date formats from Gregorian Calendar into Jalali Calendar, in both nodes and comments. It uses php's internal convertor if PHP 5.3+ and PECL_intl 1+ dependencies are satisfied , otherwise it falls back to its own convertor, which lives in persiantools/include/Date.php
