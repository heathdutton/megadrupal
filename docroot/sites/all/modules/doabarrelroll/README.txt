DO A BARREL ROLL
================

This module makes your site do a barrel roll once you type 'do a barrel roll' in the search form (either block or page). It uses CSS 3 Animation to accomplish the barrel roll, don't expect it to work on Internet Explorer any soon.

CSS developed by Dan Linn from Metal Toad, see www.metaltoad.com/blog/how-does-google-do-barrel-roll
