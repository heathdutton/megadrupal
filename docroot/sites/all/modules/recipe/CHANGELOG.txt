    '{}' \; -exec cvs add '{}.txt' \;

    I will update all occurences of 'README' to 'README.txt' in the
    conrtib CVS, soon. I'll also rename LICENSE, CHANGELOG etc. files
    as soon as I get around to it.

  * recipe.module: Added CVS Id: tag to all *.module files where it
    was missing (as required by the coding standards, see
    CODING_STANDARDS.html). I also unified the format and the

    the second line in all *.module files, now.

    'ingredients') are now included in the  searchable index.

    This module is now an example of a node module adding text fields
    to the Index. This was a bit tricky to figure out.

2003-05-26 23:08  weitzman

  * INSTALL, README, recipe.module: A major rewrite. A module for
    people to share recipes. Also a great way to get your mothers to
    use Drupal.

  * README: Added README's to nearly all the modules lacking them so
    we don't get any more broken links on the downloads page.

2003-02-15 07:36  dries

  * recipe.module: - Updated the modules in the contributions
    repository to use   'theme("function")' instead of
    '$theme->function()'.  Hopefully I didn't   break anything.  If I
    did, let me know.

      The following modules need special attention (but should still
    work as is):

      1. The ldap_integration directory has its own user.module; I
    haven't updated
         the documentation bit that talks about themes.

      2. The hotlist module uses '$theme->hotlist_del_icon'.  Should
    be avoided
         and somehow wrapped in a (larger) call to theme().

      3. The image module has its own way of doing what 'theme()'
    does (or the
         former 'theme_invoke()').  Constructs like the one below (a)
    look wrong
         and (b) should be rewritten to properly use 'theme()'.  For
    example:

         $theme->box("foo", method_exists("bar") ? $theme->bar() :
    $bar);

         Search for "image_gallery_album", "image_gallery_home" and
         "image_thumb_browser".  I've already changed '$theme->box()'
    to
         'theme()'.

      4. The sidebar module uses '$theme->foreground' and
    '$theme->background'.
         Should be avoided and somehow wrapped in a (larger) call to
    theme().

      5. The org_informations module uses '$theme->separator()',
    which is new to
         me.

      6. The taxonomy_filter module uses
    '$theme->taxolist_filter_item()'.  It
         should use 'theme("taxolist_filter_item")' instead.  I
    haven't changed
         it because it would probably fail to resolve the default
    function if
         not overridden by a theme.

      7. The taxonomy_dhtml module's INSTALL file still talks about
         '$theme->image'.

      8. The xloadtree module's INSTALL file still talks about
    '$theme->image'.

      9. I haven't updated the style.module; too many $theme's,
    though I don't
         think it needs any updates.

      [I'll try to update the sandboxes later on.]

    module.

    this is an attempt to get our mother's to use drupal :)

    requires the version of Drupal in Kjartan's sandbox. Uses new
    node API (but could easily be backported to 4.0)
