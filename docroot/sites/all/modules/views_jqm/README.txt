Views jQuery Mobile

This is a simple integrating jQuery Mobile with views.

To install simply upload to your modules directory and enable it.

jQM Basic Lists

jQM Basic Grid
-----------------------------
Number of columns
-- jQM allows for a maximum of 5 columns and a minimum or 2 columns.

Theme Swatch
-- Enter the letter or name of you theme swatch and the grid will use that swatch instead of the
  default "none". 
  
Currently the Grid only supports content or a group of fields per grid cell. I am working on allowing
each cell to contain one field, much like tables do.
