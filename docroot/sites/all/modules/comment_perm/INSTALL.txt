INSTALLATION:

1) Place this module directory in your modules folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/").

2) Enable the module.

3) Go to Administer/Content management/Comment permissions and enable the 
   extended comment permissions for certain content types here.

4) Go to Administer/User management/Access control and configure which roles 
   can post comments for the these content types.

NOTE: Comments must already be enabled for this module to do anything.  
      This module simply removes the ability for a user to post comments if 
      they don't have the right permissions.  
      It does not add the ability to comment on node types that don't have 
      commenting enabled!
