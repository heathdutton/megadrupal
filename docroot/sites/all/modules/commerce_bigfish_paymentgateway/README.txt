With BIG FISH Payment Gateway merchants can easily offer electronic payments
on their webshops.

Payment Gateway helps merchants to enable several payment services on their
websites in one step, without a time-consuming development, because the
technical communication between payment service providers and websites are
provided by the Payment Gateway and we provide an easy to use SDK to it.

  website.
