Hosting Logs
============

This module extends drush/provision to better present logs to the user.

Supported commands are:

- Makes a site's apache error log visible at http://hostmaster/node/123/logs/errors
- Makes a site's watchdog log visible at http://hostmaster/node/123/logs/dblog
- Makes the Git commit log for a site or platform repository visible at http://hostmaster/node/123/logs/git
- Can expose the apache error log at http://aegirhostedsite/error.log


Installation
============

Install as a normal drupal module in a hostmaster site.

As root create a directory for the logs.

```console
# mkdir /var/log/aegir
```

For log rotation with the standard logrotate utility, copy logrotate.d.example to /etc/logrotate.d/
