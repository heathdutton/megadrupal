 * CKEditor Line Utilities plugin
   http://ckeditor.com/addon/lineutils
 * CKEditor Widget plugin
   http://ckeditor.com/addon/widget

INSTALLATION
------------

* Install Entity Embed via the standard Drupal installation process:
  'http://drupal.org/node/895232'.
* If you weren't previously using the CKEditor WYSIWYG client-side editor,
  download the CKEditor library (http://ckeditor.com/download) and extract it to
  'sites/all/libraries' or 'sites/sitename/libraries' as you require. The
  extracted folder must be named 'ckeditor'.
* Download the Line Utilities plugin (http://ckeditor.com/addon/lineutils),
  extract it and move it into the 'plugins' directory of the 'ckeditor' folder
  so that it is available at 'ckeditor/plugins/lineutils'.
* Download the Widget plugin (http://ckeditor.com/addon/widget), extract it and
  move it into the 'plugins' directory of the 'ckeditor' folder so that it is
  available at 'ckeditor/plugins/widget'.
* Configure the jQuery Update module to use jQuery 1.7 or higher:
  '/admin/config/development/jquery_update'.
* Enable the entity-embed filter 'Display embedded entities' for the desired
  text formats from the Text Formats configuration page:
  '/admin/config/content/formats'.
* If the 'Limit allowed HTML tags' filter is enabled, add
  '<drupal-entity data-entity-type data-entity-uuid data-entity-id data-view-mode data-entity-embed-display data-entity-embed-settings>'
  to the 'Allowed HTML tags'.
* Optionally enable the filter-align filter 'Align embedded entities' to allow
  positioning of embedded entities.
* To enable the WYSIWYG plugin, move the entity-embed 'E' button into the
  Active toolbar for the desired text formats from the CKEditor configuration
  page: '/admin/config/content/ckeditor'.
* Disable CKEditor's Advanced Content Filter for each of the text formats.

By default, Entity Embed includes a single button for embedding nodes.
Additional buttons can be added from the configuration page:
'/admin/config/content/embed-button'.

USAGE
-----

Embedding entities with WYSIWYG:

* For example, create a new *Article* content.
* Click on the 'E' button in the text editor.
* Enter part of the title of the entity you're looking for and select one of the
  search results.
* For **Display as**, choose one of the following options:
  * Default
  * Full content
  * RSS
  * Search index
  * Search result highlighting input
* Optionally, choose to align left, center or right.

Embedding entities without WYSIWYG:

Users should be embedding entities using the CKEditor WYSIWYG button as
described above. This section is more technical about the HTML markup that is
used to embed the actual entity.

Embed by UUID (recommended: requires the UUID module):
<drupal-entity data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07bf3a2e-1941-4a44-9b02-2d1d7a41ec0e" data-view-module="teaser" />

Embed by ID (not recommended):
<drupal-entity data-entity-type="node" data-entity-id="1" data-view-mode="teaser" />

The above examples render the entity using the _teaser_ view mode.
