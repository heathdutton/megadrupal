2012-02-19

 - Repository finally moved to drupal.org
 - Using PHP in custom tags now requires the PHP module, and the correct permission.
   This follows the core pattern of isolating the ability to evaluate PHP code
   into a separate permission from normal administrative access.

2012-02-18 - 2.1.0

 - Repository migrated from SVN on ermarian.net to GitHub.
 - Changed the rendering algorithm to render tags even inside nocode, and then
   discard the result when the nocode tag is closed successfully. This replaces
   the old behavior of blocking all rendering, and then retroactively do it
   if the nocode tag breaks. This code was vulnerable to input that used quadratic time.
 - Stopped injecting tag content and arguments into evaluated PHP code. Instead,
   the code must access the $tag variable to get these arguments.
 - xbbcode currently has branches compatible with 7.x and 8.x.

2010-10-26 - 2.0.4-r495

 - Ported xbbcode_table and xbbcode_list.
 - Compatibility upgrade for Drupal 7: As of issue #934050, text formats use an 
   alphanumeric key instead of an integer. Global constant switched from 0 to
   GLOBAL, to avoid colliding with lowercase text format IDs.
 - Allowed using the format-level settings form for unsaved formats. The new UI
   for Drupal expects settings to work even before an actual format ID exists.
 - The long filter tips have been converted to a table to match the HTML help.
 - More generic and better samples in the xbbcode_basic module.
 - Many other small codestyle fixes and bug fixes.

2010-04-16 - 2.0.0-r462

 - Completely rewrote the parsing algorithm for BBCode. Tags are now required to be nested correctly.
   Tag weights are gone, and so is the "pairing" process.

2010-04-12 - 1.1.0-r453

 - Several significant bugs and regressions were fixed.
 - Restored compatibility with the new development version of Drupal 7 core.
 - The tag discovery process was streamlined and greatly improved.
 - Minor improvements were made to the administrative interface and help texts.

2009-12-10 - 1.0.0-r393

 - XBBCode is now compatible with Drupal 7.
 - Greatly improved the administration interface.
 - Refactored and cleaned up the code.

2008-12-26 - 1.1.1-r326

 - Fixed a bug that broke [quote] tags.
 - Fixed a bug that broke multiple-argument tags.
 - Set 0 instead of NULL defaults throughout the tables.
 - Codestyle fixes.

2008-11-16 - 1.1.0-r314

 - XBBCode is now compatible with Drupal 6.
 - The highlighter module is now standalone. It is required to use xbbcode_highlighter.
   It can be downloaded from http://ermarian.net/downloads/drupal-addons/highlighter
 - Numerous bug fixes.
 - Several UI improvements when adding custom tags: Automatic lower-case, better labels.
 - Instead of requiring sub-modules to call xbbcode_add_tags(), xbbcode discovers new tags on its own.

2008-01-20 - 0.3.1:

 - Code style of xbbcode module is now conforming to Drupal standards at last.
 - Several globals have been gotten rid of by placing them as statics into designated functions.
   This keeps the global namespace uncluttered while still allowing the caching of such variables.
 - The tags of a filter are now cached better, using static and Drupal's own caching system.
 - A bug in the parsing of arguments was fixed, which unexpectedly converted spaces to &nbsp; and
   also lost values that were surrounded by single quotes.
   
This is the LAST VERSION of xbbcode that marks a JOINT development. After the last commit, the present trunk
was branched for a DRUPAL-5 version. The trunk will now be upgraded to Drupal 6.x compatibility.

2007-07-07 - 0.3:

 - Code-style cleanup everywhere
 - Removed the static XBBCode class as counter to Drupal structure, replaced with _xbbcode_%s functions.
 - Removed a MySQL version incompatibility that messed up a Natural Join
 - Removed a MySQL version incompatibility (and Drupal style incongruence) by replacing BOOLEAN with INT(1)
 - Filter is now cacheable, automatically resets cache on tag changes.

2007-07-06 - 0.2.2:

 - Modules now register their tags on installation
 - highlighter now tries to detect the PEAR libraries on installation
 - XBBCode can now autoclose tags left open at the end of text (optional)
 - XBBCode now works in PHP 4, thanks to the removal of several foreach($a as &$b) constructs

2007-07-01 - 0.2:

 - Refactored most of the module code, fixing the install system in the process
 - Renamed all the modules to conform with standards.
 

2007-02-16 - 0.1.2:

 - Tags can now be weighted. Parsing follows first weight, then text order.
 - The same tag name can be registered by different modules. Conflicts in the tag namespace 
   can be resolved by the admin, on a per-format basis.
 - Unified the infrastructure; *all* tags are now provided by modules. Admin-created tags 
   are provided through this module's own _xbbcode hook.

2007-02-12 - 0.1.1:

 - Fixed a bug that broke self-closing tags.
 - Fixed a bug that caused strings of form "$name" to disappear from dynamically parsed tags.
 - Fixed a bug that added backslashes to quote characters in dynamic tags.
 
 - Added multiple-arguments functionality for static tags.
