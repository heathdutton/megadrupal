This module allows you to check the value of a field and use this to determine whether to import a value.  For example, given two fields:

PermissionToDisplayPhoneNumber
PhoneNumber

You could decide to only import PhoneNumber if PermissionToImportPhoneNumber equals 'yes'.

There are several options for compairons including equals, does not equal, greater, less, contains etc.
