Drupal Commerce Responsive UI is packaged for download at http://drupal.org/project/commerce_responsive_ui

The Commerce Responsive UI (commerce_responsive_ui) module will provide drop-in replacements or CSS fixes for all of the table-based Views and interfaces in Drupal Commerce that are non-responsive by default. These replacements include:

# Shopping cart form
# Order total area handler
# Shopping cart contents checkout pane
# Address field
# Coupon code checkout pane
# Review checkout pane (see https://www.drupal.org/node/1098028)
# Order view page (line items table and shipment table)

The shopping cart block is not in scope for now.
