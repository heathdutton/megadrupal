Mica
------------------------

These modules allow to create web portals for epidemiological study consortia.

Using Mica, consortia can build personalised web sites for publishing their research activities and their membership.
Mica includes many domain-specific features such as study catalogues, data dictionary browsers, on-line data access
request forms, community tools (forums, events, news) and others.

Moreover, Mica includes a powerful data search engine that allows authenticated researchers to perform distributed queries
on the content of each individual study data collection hosted by the OBiBa Opal database software (http://www.obiba.org/node/63).


REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

Mica depends on Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr), the Search API module
provides already some documentation for setting up a Solr server.

See the "Setting up Solr" paragraph at its documentation:
  http://drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/7.x-1.x:/INSTALL.txt


INSTALLATION
------------------------

We strongly recommend to use Mica with the Mica Distribution installation profile. It provides basic configuration of the Mica modules.
