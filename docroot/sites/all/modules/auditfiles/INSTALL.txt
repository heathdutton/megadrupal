RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
 * No additional modules are necessary.


INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.


PERMISSIONS
-----------
 * Configure user permissions in Administration > People > Permissions > Audit
   Files (admin/people/permissions#module-auditfiles):
   * Access Audit Files' reports: Users with this permission are allowed access
     to the various file audit reports.
   * Administer Audit Files: Users with this permission are allowed to access
     and change the system administrative configuration settings (described
     below) for this module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
 * Configure the module in Administration > Configuration and modules > System >
   Audit Files menu (admin/config/system/auditfiles).
   * File system paths: This allows system administrators to specify which file
     system to use when querying and comparing files on the file system with
     what is recorded in the database.
     * File system path: Select the file system path to use. The default is
       the path specified in Drupal's Public files setting.
   * Exclusions: There may be some files, file extensions and/or directories
     that you do not want to taken into consideration when generating the
     various reports. These fields allow the site administrator the ability to
     exclude those items. In each field, enter in the list of respective items
     to exclude. Separate each exclusion with a  semi-colon. These are the three
     fields:
     * Exclude these files: List in here all specific files to be excluded from
       the reports. By default, only .htaccess is excluded.
     * Exclude these extensions: List in here all file extensions to exclude
       from the reports. Any file found with any of these extensions will be
       excluded from the reports. By default, no extensions are excluded.
     * Exclude these paths: List in here all paths to exclude from searching for
       files through. By default, the color, css, ctools, and js paths are
       excluded.
   * Domains
     * Include references to these domains: Here you may enter a list of domains
       that will be considered local to the site in the reports for the purposes
       of creating links.
   * Report options: These are various configuration options for how to format
     certain items in the reports.
     * Date format: This is the date format that is used when displaying file's
       date in the reports. Date types and formats can be modified in the system
       Date and time settings pages, located at Administration > Configuration >
       Regional and language (admin/config/regional/date-time).
     * Number of items per page: This is the number of items to display on each
       page of a report. If there are more than this number on a page, then a
       pager will be used to display the additional items. Set this to 0 to show
       all items on a single page.
     * Maximum records: This is the maximum number of records to load for each
       report. If any report is timing out, set this to some positive integer to
       limit the number of records that are loaded.
       See the Limiting Features Explained section in the README.txt file for
       more information. Set this to 0 for no limit.
     * Batch size: This the maximum number of records to load for each report
       using Drupal's Batch API. Because Drupal's Batch API resets the HTTP
       request during the process, a much larger number can be used here to load
       more records on a report.
       See the Limiting Features Explained section in the README.txt file for
       more information. Set this to 0 for no limit.
