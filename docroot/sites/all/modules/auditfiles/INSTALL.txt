RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
 * No additional modules are necessary.


INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.


PERMISSIONS
-----------
 * Configure user permissions in Administration > People > Permissions > Audit
   Files (admin/people/permissions#module-auditfiles):
   * Access Audit Files' reports: Users with this permission are allowed access
     to the various file audit reports.
   * Administer Audit Files: Users with this permission are allowed to access
     and change the system administrative configuration settings (described
     below) for this module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
 * Configure the module in Administration > Configuration and modules > System >
   Audit Files menu (admin/config/system/auditfiles).
   * Exclusions: There may be some files, file extensions and/or directories
     that you do not want to taken into consideration when generating the
     various reports. These fields allow the site administrator the ability to
     exclude those items. In each field, enter in the list of respective items
     to exclude. Separate each exclusion with a  semi-colon. These are the three
     fields:
     * Exclude these files: List in here all specific files to be excluded from
       the reports. By default, only .htaccess is excluded.
     * Exclude these extensions: List in here all file extensions to exclude
       from the reports. Any file found with any of these extensions will be
       excluded from the reports. By default, no extensions are excluded.
     * Exclude these paths: List in here all paths to exclude from searching for
       files through. By default, the color, css, ctools, and js paths are
       excluded.
   * Domains
     * Include references to these domains: Here you may enter a list of domains
       that will be considered local to the site in the reports for the purposes
       of creating links.
   * Report options: These are various configuration options for how to format
     certain items in the reports.
     * Date format: This is the date format that is used when displaying file's
       date in the reports. Date types and formats can be modified in the system
       Date and time settings pages, located at Administration > Configuration >
       Regional and language (admin/config/regional/date-time).
     * Number of items per page: This is the number of items to display on each
       page of a report. If there are more than this number on a page, then a
       pager will be used to display the additional items. Set this to 0 to show
       all items on a single page.
     * Maximum records: This is the maximum number of records to return for each
       report. If any of the reports are timing out, set this to some positive
       integer to limit the number of records that are queried in the database.
       See the Limiting Features Explained section in the README.txt file for
       more information. Set this to 0 for no limit.
     * Batch set size: This the number of records to use for displaying data
       in batches. Enter a positive integer here and the batch operations will
       be broken up into sets of this number of records. See the Limiting
       Features Explained section in the README.txt file for more information.
       Set this to 0 for no limit.
