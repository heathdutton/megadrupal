------------
* auditfiles.notindatabase.inc, auditfiles.notonserver.inc,
  auditfiles.managednotused.inc, auditfiles.usednotmanaged.inc,
  auditfiles.usednotreferenced.inc, auditfiles.referencednotused.inc
  - Removed batch offset calculation from *_get_file_list() functions.
  - Changed the reports to not reset the file list when adding or deleting files
    or records.

  auditfiles.usednotmanaged.inc, auditfiles.usednotreferenced.inc,
  auditfiles.referencednotused.inc
  - Fixed the add/delete operation messages to show the correct information.

9 July 2015 (oadaeh)
-----------
* auditfiles.notindatabase.inc:
  - Rename variables from $file_id to $file_name.
  - Change confirmation dialog to use the array value and not the key, as that
    sometimes produced results that were using the numbered array keys, instead
    of the filenames.
  - Removed the path modification fucntionality from
    _auditfiles_not_in_database_batch_delete_process_file(), as the file
    pathname is already correct, and the functionality sometimes produced
    results that were incorrect, when the root already existed, but was
    different (in the case of symbolic links).

  - Default the selection for the file to keep to the one with the lowest file
    ID.

5 July 2015 (oadaeh)
-----------
* auditfiles.notindatabase.inc:
  - Fixed record selection function so it respects admin specified record
    limiters.
* auditfiles.managednotused.inc, auditfiles.notindatabase.inc,
  auditfiles.notonserver.inc, auditfiles.referencednotused.inc,

  auditfiles.managednotused.inc and auditfiles.usednotmanaged.inc:
  - Completed refactoring the reports to allow for loading them using Drupal's
    Batch API.
    As part of this effort, a concept of batch limiting was created and
    implemented (called Batch Sets, and using the $batch_size, $record_limiters,
    $record_selection and $maximum_records variables), for times when the batch
    process timed out or exceeded memory limitations.
    (The add and/or delete functionalities no longer work, because the
    conversion to Batch API for them is not yet complete.)

13 May 2015 (oadaeh)
-----------

    especially with updating content).
