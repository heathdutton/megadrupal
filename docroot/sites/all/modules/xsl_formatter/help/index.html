<h1>Configuring XSL Formatter module</h1>

<p class="intro">Some usage examples.</p>
You will
<ol>
    <li>Construct a content type, eg "Updates".
</li><li>Attach a field to that content type to hold the XML data.
</li><li>Edit the display settings to provide an XSL template that transforms the XML
into something readable.
</li></ol></p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Enable the XSL formatter module. This provides a new 'Format'
        called "<strong>Transformed by XSL</strong>" that can be applied to
        <strong>text</strong>, <strong>file</strong> and <strong>link</strong> field types.
    </li>
    <li>Create or edit your chosen content type.
        ( <em>Home » Administration » Structure » Content types</em> )
        to add your field.<p>

            <img src="images/xsl_formatter-manage_fields.png"
                 alt="Content type Manage Fields UI"/>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        "<strong>Manage Display</strong>" of your content type, and select "<strong>Transformed by XSL</strong>"
        as the format.
        In the display settings, choose or upload your XSL file.
        <p>
            <img src="images/xsl_formatter-manage_display.png"
                 alt="Content type Manage Display UI"/>
        </p>
        Uploaded XSL files will be available for re-use in other fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's recommended to start by choosing one of the
        'verbatim' or 'pretty-print' XSL files that comes with the project
        before adding your own. This will demonstrate how the base system
        works before introducing the complexity of XSL debugging.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
    XML and XSL are very picky syntaxes, and it's easy for things to go wrong.
    Debugging info should be available in the Watchdog logs, with explanations
    of errors found during parsing.
</p>

<p>
    Using the remote URL source for your data can be problematic.
    A network request to the original is made on each pageload, and if the
    target is slow or offline, your page will be also.!
    <br/>
    The module uses the
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/domdocument.load.php">DOMDocument::load</a>
    function directly, so all issues related to that apply.
    No additional headers, proxy configs or authentication are supported here.
</p>

<p>
    As this request happens in realtime (on render request) it can be terribly
    inefficient if you display this field in a list of views or anything.
    <br/>
    Drupal-level caching *may* help somewhat, but for performance
    you are probably better to switch to using
    <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds module</a>
    (plus <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds_xpathparser">Feeds XPath
    Parser</a>)
    to do your XML importing instead.
