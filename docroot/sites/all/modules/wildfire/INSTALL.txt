------------------------------------
-- Wildfire 2 client for Drupal 7 --
------------------------------------

== INSTALLATION ==

1. Download the Wildfire 2 client from http://drupal.org/project/wildfire

2. Install the module into your sites modules folder. Typically, this is
   sites/all/modules or sites/<yoursite>/modules

3. Enable the module and all required child modules. If you just enable
   the Core (wildfire) module, it should take care of the rest for you, but if
   you need to perform this step manually, the modules you will
   need are:

   Core (wildfire), Messages (wildfire_messages), Broadcasts
   (wildfire_broadcasts), Jobs (wildfire_jobs), Lists (wildfire_lists),
   RPC Jobs (wildfire_rpc_jobs), Tracking and reports (wildfire_tracking),
   Auth (wildfire_auth).

4. Visit http://wildfirehq.co.uk, and either log in if you have an existing
   account, or sign up if you don't.

5. From within your account view page, your systems machine name and auth key
   are displayed. Copy these into the corresponding places in the client admin
   page at Adminstration >> Wildfire >> Settings, under the "General settings"
   tab.
   Note that jobs won't be sent to the Wildfire HQ servers if this step is
   skipped.

6. Set up some mail templates for your site. An built-in example can be found
   in the 'mailtemplates' folder of the Wildfire module. Each template should
   be placed into a subfolder of a 'mailtemplates' folder within your site
   (e.g. at sites/<yoursite>/mailtemplates/<yourtemplate>)

7. Enable and verify your mail template from Administration >> Wildfire >>
   Templates. If your template has settings, these can be also be adjusted from
   the 'settings' links on that page.

8. Enable the content types that you want to be able to send in a mailout from
   Administration >> Wildfire >> Settings, under the "Content types settings"
   tab. This also controls whether the 'Add to broadcast' link appears when
   viewing a node of that content type.

9. Ensure that the 'Wildfire' display for the node content types is set up
   appropriately for how you wish nodes to appear in your mail template i.e.
   Administration >> Structure >> Content types, them 'manange display' on
   the content types you will be using in your mail outs.

10.If you wish to be able to use full HTML within snippet regions, please
   change the default text format on Administration >> Wildfire >> Settings,
   under the "Regions settings" tab. You will need to ensure that the user
   account designated to use Wildfire also has permissions to use the given
   text format.
