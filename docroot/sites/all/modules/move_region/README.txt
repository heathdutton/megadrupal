Description
-----------
The Move Region module allows you to move the content of a region in its
entirety into another region on specified pages. This is especially useful for
pages that need to have a different region layout, for example having the
sidebar on the opposite side of the main content.


Usage
-----
1. Enable this module on the Modules page.
2. Create a new configuration at "Configuration" -> "Content Authoring" -> "Move
   Region" -> "Add configuration" (admin/config/content/move-region/add).
3. Choose the region that should be moved (the "source" region) and the one it
   should be moved to (the "destination" region) from the dropdown menus.
4. Specify on which pages the region should be moved. This works exactly like
   the block configuration, so you can use '*' as a wildcard, and '<front>' for
   the front page.
5. Save the configuration.

If you need multiple configurations you can manage them from the main
configuration screen. The configurations can also be edited or deleted if
needed.
