Description
-----------
This module adds a new type of Webform components: Bootstrap layout elements. By placing webform fields inside layout boxes, you can arrange them into rows and columns.

How to use
----------
- Go to the main field list of a webform.
- Add a bootstrap rows and columns to your form.
- Save the component.
- Add or drag other fields into the container.
- Be careful, some components are too wide by default (e.g. textfield). So, you may need to adjust them in order to fit side-by-side.
- If you need a title and/or description for your group you can add markup to the form, or insert the layout container into a fieldset.
