Changes since 7.x-1.2 :

 * Added pgnData as possible attribute to allow for bigger PGN files.

 * Added several [pgn] tag parameters such as initialHalfmove,
   autoplayMode and others.

 * Add "Configure" link to "Modules" page.

Changes in 7.x-1.2 :

 * Global configuration of board.html look and feel.

 * Added documentation about pgn4web-2.57-board-minimal.zip.

 * Use xbbcode module instead of our own filter.  This is more robust as
   we don't have to reinvent the wheel and parse strings ourselves.

Changes in 7.x-1.1 :

 * Changed Pgn4web to pgn4web as the author of pgn4web prefers it this way.

 * Added comment about requiring "Libraries API" module.

 * Added dependency on "Libraries API" module version 2.x.

 * Allow for multiple games in one PGN.  Added pgn4web-multiple as class to
   the generated iframe in this case.

Changes in 7.x-1.0 :

 * Initial release.
