Feeds Callback Fetcher
======================

When importing content with Feeds, people uses different URLs.
Those are generated by Views (RSS, XML, JSON), some others by custom modules.

The problem
===========
It also happend that some of these URLs can be guessed by people and/or search engine.

The questions
=============
How to disable the access to those URLs for the anonymous user and let cron access to them ?  

The solution
============
This module has been created for fixing this.
I needed a way to retrieve informations from URLs, but I didn't want those to be guessable or available to anyone.

How it works ?
==============
This module calls a callback function to get it's content instead of calling an URL.

Example of use in a hook_cron():
================================
<?php
function hook_cron() {
  //Get the importer
  $source = feeds_source('my_custom_job_importer');

  // Configure the callback
  $fetcher_config['callback'] = '_custom_get_jobs';
  $source->setConfigFor($source->importer->fetcher, $fetcher_config);

  // trigger the importation
  $source->save();
  }
?>
