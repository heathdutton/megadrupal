DESCRIPTION
-----------
Relate profile field categories to particular roles, instead of all fields
being related to all roles. Use profile to define all user data fields, but
restrict which fields are related to users of a particular role. The interface
allows you to relate profile field categories to roles. As the screenshot
depicts, one or more roles may be assigned to a give field category.

For example you may create two roles (parent and child) and two corresponding
profile field categories:

Parent
- Employer
- Occupation

Child
- School
- Grade
