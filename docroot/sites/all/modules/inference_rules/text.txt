the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails and was at rest the flood had made the wind was nearly
calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide

the sea-reach of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway in the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits a
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness
the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest
and the greatest town on earth

the director of companies was our captain and our host we four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom

between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of
the sea besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each others
yarns and even convictions the lawyer the best of old fellows had
because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck
and was lying on the only rug the accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones marlow
sat cross-legged right aft leaning against the mizzen-mast he had
sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect
and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an
idol the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way
aft and sat down amongst us we exchanged a few words lazily afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht for some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes we felt meditative and fit for nothing
but placid staring the day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance the water shone pacifically the sky without a
speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the
essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded
rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds only the
gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more sombre
every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun

and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat
as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men

forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound the old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth we looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories and
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes
followed the sea with reverence and affection that to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames the tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled
and untitled the great knights-errant of the sea it had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from
the _golden hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure to be
visited by the queens highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale
to the _erebus_ and _terror_ bound on other conquests and that never
returned it had known the ships and the men they had sailed from
deptford from greenwich from erith the adventurers and the settlers
kings ships and the ships of men on change captains admirals the
dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals
of east india fleets hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all
had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch
messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river
into the mystery of an unknown earth! the dreams of men the seed
of commonwealths the germs of empires

the sun set the dusk fell on the stream and lights began to appear
along the shore the chapman light-house a three-legged thing erect
on a mud-flat shone strongly lights of ships moved in the fairway a
great stir of lights going up and going down and farther west on the
upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously
on the sky a brooding gloom in sunshine a lurid glare under the stars

and this also said marlow suddenly has been one of the dark places
of the earth

he was the only man of us who still followed the sea the worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class he was a
seaman but he was a wanderer too while most seamen lead if one may
so express it a sedentary life their minds are of the stay-at-home
order and their home is always with them the ship and so is their
country the sea one ship is very much like another and the sea is
always the same in the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores the foreign faces the changing immensity of life glide past
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny
for the rest after his hours of work a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing the yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut but marlow was not typical if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine

his remark did not seem at all surprising it was just like marlow
it was accepted in silence no one took the trouble to grunt even and
presently he said very slow i was thinking of very old times when
the romans first came here nineteen hundred years ago the other day
 light came out of this river since you say knights? yes but
it is like a running blaze on a plain like a flash of lightning in the
clouds we live in the flicker may it last as long as the old earth
keeps rolling! but darkness was here yesterday imagine the feelings
of a commander of a fine what dye call em? trireme in the
mediterranean ordered suddenly to the north run overland across the
gauls in a hurry put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries a
wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too used to build
apparently by the hundred in a month or two if we may believe what we
read imagine him here the very end of the world a sea the colour
of lead a sky the colour of smoke a kind of ship about as rigid as a
concertina and going up this river with stores or orders or what you
like sand-banks marshes forests savages precious little to eat
fit for a civilized man nothing but thames water to drink no falernian
wine here no going ashore here and there a military camp lost in
a wilderness like a needle in a bundle of hay cold fog tempests
disease exile and death death skulking in the air in the water in
the bush they must have been dying like flies here oh yes he did
it did it very well too no doubt and without thinking much about
it either except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his
time perhaps they were men enough to face the darkness and perhaps he
was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at
ravenna by and by if he had good friends in rome and survived the awful
climate or think of a decent young citizen in a toga perhaps too
much dice you know coming out here in the train of some prefect or
tax-gatherer or trader even to mend his fortunes land in a swamp
march through the woods and in some inland post feel the savagery the
utter savagery had closed round him all that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest in the jungles in the hearts of
wild men theres no initiation either into such mysteries he has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible which is also detestable and
it has a fascination too that goes to work upon him the fascination
of the abomination you know imagine the growing regrets the longing
to escape the powerless disgust the surrender the hate

he paused

mind he began again lifting one arm from the elbow the palm of the
hand outwards so that with his legs folded before him he had the
pose of a buddha preaching in european clothes and without a
lotus-flower mind none of us would feel exactly like this what saves
us is efficiency the devotion to efficiency but these chaps were not
much account really they were no colonists their administration was
merely a squeeze and nothing more i suspect they were conquerors and
for that you want only brute force nothing to boast of when you have
it since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
others they grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to
be got it was just robbery with violence aggravated murder on a great
scale and men going at it blind as is very proper for those who tackle
a darkness the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking
it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter
noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it too
much what redeems it is the idea only an idea at the back of it not
a sentimental pretence but an idea and an unselfish belief in the
idea something you can set up and bow down before and offer a
sacrifice to

he broke off flames glided in the river small green flames red
flames white flames pursuing overtaking joining crossing each
other then separating slowly or hastily the traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river we looked on
waiting patiently there was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood but it was only after a long silence when he said in
a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn
fresh-water sailor for a bit that we knew we were fated before
the ebb began to run to hear about one of marlows inconclusive
experiences

i dont want to bother you much with what happened to me personally
he began showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to
hear yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how i
got out there what i saw how i went up that river to the place where i
first met the poor chap it was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experience it seemed somehow to throw a kind
of light on everything about me and into my thoughts it was sombre
enough too and pitiful not extraordinary in any way not very clear
either no not very clear and yet it seemed to throw a kind of light

i had then as you remember just returned to london after a lot of
indian ocean pacific china seas a regular dose of the east six years
or so and i was loafing about hindering you fellows in your work and
invading your homes just as though i had got a heavenly mission to
civilize you it was very fine for a time but after a bit i did get
tired of resting then i began to look for a ship i should think the
hardest work on earth but the ships wouldnt even look at me and i got
tired of that game too

now when i was a little chap i had a passion for maps i would look for
hours at south america or africa or australia and lose myself in all
the glories of exploration at that time there were many blank spaces on
the earth and when i saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map
but they all look that i would put my finger on it and say when
i grow up i will go there the north pole was one of these places i
remember well i havent been there yet and shall not try now the
glamours off other places were scattered about the hemispheres i
have been in some of them and well we wont talk about that but
there was one yet the biggest the most blank so to speak that i had
a hankering after

true by this time it was not a blank space any more it had got filled
since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names it had ceased to be
a blank space of delightful mystery a white patch for a boy to dream
gloriously over it had become a place of darkness but there was in it
one river especially a mighty big river that you could see on the map
resembling an immense snake uncoiled with its head in the sea its
body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the
depths of the land and as i looked at the map of it in a shop-window
it fascinated me as a snake would a bird a silly little bird then i
remembered there was a big concern a company for trade on that river
dash it all! i thought to myself they cant trade without using some
kind of craft on that lot of fresh water steamboats! why shouldnt i
try to get charge of one? i went on along fleet street but could not
shake off the idea the snake had charmed me

you understand it was a continental concern that trading society but
i have a lot of relations living on the continent because its cheap
and not so nasty as it looks they say

i am sorry to own i began to worry them this was already a fresh
departure for me i was not used to get things that way you know i
always went my own road and on my own legs where i had a mind to go i
wouldnt have believed it of myself but then you see i felt somehow
i must get there by hook or by crook so i worried them the men said
my dear fellow and did nothing then would you believe it? i tried
the women i charlie marlow set the women to work to get a job
heavens! well you see the notion drove me i had an aunt a dear
enthusiastic soul she wrote: it will be delightful i am ready to do
anything anything for you it is a glorious idea i know the wife of a
very high personage in the administration and also a man who has lots
of influence with etc she was determined to make no end of fuss to
get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat if such was my fancy

i got my appointment of course and i got it very quick it appears
the company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives this was my chance and it made me the
more anxious to go it was only months and months afterwards when i
made the attempt to recover what was left of the body that i heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens yes
two black hens fresleven that was the fellows name a dane thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick oh it didnt surprise
me in the least to hear this and at the same time to be told that
fresleven was the gentlest quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs no doubt he was but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause you know and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly while a big crowd of his people
watched him thunderstruck till some man i was told the chiefs
son in desperation at hearing the old chap yell made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades then the whole population cleared into the forest
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen while on the other hand
the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic in charge of
the engineer i believe afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about freslevens remains till i got out and stepped into his shoes i
couldnt let it rest though but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones they were all there the supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell and the village was deserted the huts gaped
black rotting all askew within the fallen enclosures a calamity
had come to it sure enough the people had vanished mad terror had
scattered them men women and children through the bush and they had
never returned what became of the hens i dont know either i should
think the cause of progress got them anyhow however through this
glorious affair i got my appointment before i had fairly begun to hope
for it

i flew around like mad to get ready and before forty-eight hours i
was crossing the channel to show myself to my employers and sign the
contract in a very few hours i arrived in a city that always makes me
think of a whited sepulchre prejudice no doubt i had no difficulty in
finding the companys offices it was the biggest thing in the town
and everybody i met was full of it they were going to run an over-sea
empire and make no end of coin by trade

a narrow and deserted street in deep shadow high houses innumerable
windows with venetian blinds a dead silence grass sprouting right and
left immense double doors standing ponderously ajar i slipped through
one of these cracks went up a swept and ungarnished staircase as arid
as a desert and opened the first door i came to two women one fat and
the other slim sat on straw-bottomed chairs knitting black wool the
slim one got up and walked straight at me still knitting with downcast
eyes and only just as i began to think of getting out of her way as
you would for a somnambulist stood still and looked up her dress was
as plain as an umbrella-cover and she turned round without a word and
preceded me into a waiting-room i gave my name and looked about deal
table in the middle plain chairs all round the walls on one end a
large shining map marked with all the colours of a rainbow there was a
vast amount of red good to see at any time because one knows that some
real work is done in there a deuce of a lot of blue a little green
smears of orange and on the east coast a purple patch to show where
the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer however i
wasnt going into any of these i was going into the yellow dead in
the centre and the river was there fascinating deadly like a snake
ough! a door opened a white-haired secretarial head but wearing a
compassionate expression appeared and a skinny forefinger beckoned me
into the sanctuary its light was dim and a heavy writing-desk squatted
in the middle from behind that structure came out an impression of pale
plumpness in a frock-coat the great man himself he was five feet
six i should judge and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many
millions he shook hands i fancy murmured vaguely was satisfied with
my french _bon voyage_

in about forty-five seconds i found myself again in the waiting-room
with the compassionate secretary who full of desolation and sympathy
made me sign some document i believe i undertook amongst other things
not to disclose any trade secrets well i am not going to

i began to feel slightly uneasy you know i am not used to such
ceremonies and there was something ominous in the atmosphere it
was just as though i had been let into some conspiracy i dont
know something not quite right and i was glad to get out in the outer
room the two women knitted black wool feverishly people were arriving
and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them the
old one sat on her chair her flat cloth slippers were propped up on
a foot-warmer and a cat reposed on her lap she wore a starched
white affair on her head had a wart on one cheek and silver-rimmed
spectacles hung on the tip of her nose she glanced at me above the
glasses the swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me
two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over
and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom she
seemed to know all about them and about me too an eerie feeling came
over me she seemed uncanny and fateful often far away there i thought
of these two guarding the door of darkness knitting black wool as for
a warm pall one introducing introducing continuously to the unknown
the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old
eyes _ave!_ old knitter of black wool _morituri te salutant_ not
many of those she looked at ever saw her again not half by a long way

there was yet a visit to the doctor a simple formality assured me
the secretary with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows
accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow some
clerk i suppose there must have been clerks in the business though
the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead came from
somewhere up-stairs and led me forth he was shabby and careless with
inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket and his cravat was large and
billowy under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot it was a
little too early for the doctor so i proposed a drink and thereupon he
developed a vein of joviality as we sat over our vermouths he glorified
the companys business and by and by i expressed casually my surprise
at him not going out there he became very cool and collected all at
once i am not such a fool as i look quoth plato to his disciples
he said sententiously emptied his glass with great resolution and we
rose

the old doctor felt my pulse evidently thinking of something else
the while good good for there he mumbled and then with a certain
eagerness asked me whether i would let him measure my head rather
surprised i said yes when he produced a thing like calipers and got
the dimensions back and front and every way taking notes carefully he
was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine with
his feet in slippers and i thought him a harmless fool i always ask
leave in the interests of science to measure the crania of those going
out there he said and when they come back too? i asked oh i
never see them he remarked and moreover the changes take place
inside you know he smiled as if at some quiet joke so you are
going out there famous interesting too he gave me a searching
glance and made another note ever any madness in your family? he
asked in a matter-of-fact tone i felt very annoyed is that question
in the interests of science too? it would be he said without
taking notice of my irritation interesting for science to watch the
mental changes of individuals on the spot but are you an
alienist? i interrupted every doctor should be a little answered
that original imperturbably i have a little theory which you
messieurs who go out there must help me to prove this is my share
in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a
magnificent dependency the mere wealth i leave to others pardon my
questions but you are the first englishman coming under my
observation i hastened to assure him i was not in the least typical
if i were said i i wouldnt be talking like this with you what
you say is rather profound and probably erroneous he said with a
laugh avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun _adieu_ how do
you english say eh? good-bye ah! good-bye _adieu_ in the tropics one
must before everything keep calm he lifted a warning forefinger
_du calme du calme_

one thing more remained to do say good-bye to my excellent aunt i
found her triumphant i had a cup of tea the last decent cup of tea for
many days and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would
expect a ladys drawing-room to look we had a long quiet chat by the
fireside in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me
i had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary and goodness
knows to how many more people besides as an exceptional and gifted
creature a piece of good fortune for the company a man you dont get
hold of every day good heavens! and i was going to take charge of a
two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! it
appeared however i was also one of the workers with a capital you
know something like an emissary of light something like a lower sort
of apostle there had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk
just about that time and the excellent woman living right in the rush
of all that humbug got carried off her feet she talked about weaning
those ignorant millions from their horrid ways till upon my word she
made me quite uncomfortable i ventured to hint that the company was run
for profit

you forget dear charlie that the labourer is worthy of his hire
she said brightly its queer how out of touch with truth women are
they live in a world of their own and there has never been anything
like it and never can be it is too beautiful altogether and if they
were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset some
confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the
day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over

after this i got embraced told to wear flannel be sure to write
often and so on and i left in the street i dont know why a queer
feeling came to me that i was an imposter odd thing that i who used to
clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours notice with
less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street had a
moment i wont say of hesitation but of startled pause before this
commonplace affair the best way i can explain it to you is by saying
that for a second or two i felt as though instead of going to the
centre of a continent i were about to set off for the centre of the
earth

i left in a french steamer and she called in every blamed port they
have out there for as far as i could see the sole purpose of landing
soldiers and custom-house officers i watched the coast watching a
coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma there
it is before you smiling frowning inviting grand mean insipid or
savage and always mute with an air of whispering come and find out
this one was almost featureless as if still in the making with
an aspect of monotonous grimness the edge of a colossal jungle so
dark-green as to be almost black fringed with white surf ran straight
like a ruled line far far away along a blue sea whose glitter was
blurred by a creeping mist the sun was fierce the land seemed to
glisten and drip with steam here and there greyish-whitish specks
showed up clustered inside the white surf with a flag flying above
them perhaps settlements some centuries old and still no bigger than
pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background we pounded along
stopped landed soldiers went on landed custom-house clerks to levy
toll in what looked like a god-forsaken wilderness with a tin shed
and a flag-pole lost in it landed more soldiers to take care of the
custom-house clerks presumably some i heard got drowned in the surf
but whether they did or not nobody seemed particularly to care they
were just flung out there and on we went every day the coast
looked the same as though we had not moved but we passed various
places trading places with names like gran bassam little popo names
that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister
back-cloth the idleness of a passenger my isolation amongst all these
men with whom i had no point of contact the oily and languid sea the
uniform sombreness of the coast seemed to keep me away from the truth
of things within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion the
voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure like the
speech of a brother it was something natural that had its reason that
had a meaning now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary
contact with reality it was paddled by black fellows you could see
from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening they shouted sang
their bodies streamed with perspiration they had faces like grotesque
masks these chaps but they had bone muscle a wild vitality an
intense energy of movement that was as natural and true as the surf
along their coast they wanted no excuse for being there they were a
great comfort to look at for a time i would feel i belonged still to
a world of straightforward facts but the feeling would not last long
something would turn up to scare it away once i remember we came upon
a man-of-war anchored off the coast there wasnt even a shed there and
she was shelling the bush it appears the french had one of their wars
going on thereabouts her ensign dropped limp like a rag the muzzles
of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull the greasy
slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down swaying her thin
masts in the empty immensity of earth sky and water there she was
incomprehensible firing into a continent pop would go one of the
six-inch guns a small flame would dart and vanish a little white smoke
would disappear a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech and
nothing happened nothing could happen there was a touch of insanity in
the proceeding a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight and it was
not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was
a camp of natives he called them enemies! hidden out of sight
somewhere

we gave her her letters i heard the men in that lonely ship were dying
of fever at the rate of three a day and went on we called at some more
places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade
goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb
all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf as if nature
herself had tried to ward off intruders in and out of rivers streams
of death in life whose banks were rotting into mud whose waters
thickened into slime invaded the contorted mangroves that seemed to
writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair nowhere did we
stop long enough to get a particularized impression but the general
sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me it was like a weary
pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares

it was upward of thirty days before i saw the mouth of the big river
we anchored off the seat of the government but my work would not begin
till some two hundred miles farther on so as soon as i could i made a
start for a place thirty miles higher up

i had my passage on a little sea-going steamer her captain was a
swede and knowing me for a seaman invited me on the bridge he was a
young man lean fair and morose with lanky hair and a shuffling gait
as we left the miserable little wharf he tossed his head contemptuously
at the shore been living there? he asked i said yes fine lot
these government chaps are they not? he went on speaking english
with great precision and considerable bitterness it is funny what some
people will do for a few francs a month i wonder what becomes of that
kind when it goes upcountry? i said to him i expected to see that
soon so-o-o! he exclaimed he shuffled athwart keeping one eye ahead
vigilantly dont be too sure he continued the other day i took
up a man who hanged himself on the road he was a swede too
hanged himself! why in gods name? i cried he kept on looking
out watchfully who knows? the sun too much for him or the country
perhaps

at last we opened a reach a rocky cliff appeared mounds of turned-up
earth by the shore houses on a hill others with iron roofs amongst a
waste of excavations or hanging to the declivity a continuous noise of
the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation a
lot of people mostly black and naked moved about like ants a jetty
projected into the river a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times
in a sudden recrudescence of glare theres your companys station
said the swede pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the
rocky slope i will send your things up four boxes did you say? so
farewell

i came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass then found a path
leading up the hill it turned aside for the boulders and also for an
undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in
the air one was off the thing looked as dead as the carcass of some
animal i came upon more pieces of decaying machinery a stack of rusty
rails to the left a clump of trees made a shady spot where dark things
seemed to stir feebly i blinked the path was steep a horn tooted to
the right and i saw the black people run a heavy and dull detonation
shook the ground a puff of smoke came out of the cliff and that was
all no change appeared on the face of the rock they were building a
railway the cliff was not in the way or anything but this objectless
blasting was all the work going on

a slight clinking behind me made me turn my head six black men
advanced in a file toiling up the path they walked erect and slow
balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads and the clink kept
time with their footsteps black rags were wound round their loins and
the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails i could see every
rib the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope each had an
iron collar on his neck and all were connected together with a chain
whose bights swung between them rhythmically clinking another report
from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war i had seen
firing into a continent it was the same kind of ominous voice but
these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies they
were called criminals and the outraged law like the bursting shells
had come to them an insoluble mystery from the sea all their meagre
breasts panted together the violently dilated nostrils quivered the
eyes stared stonily uphill they passed me within six inches without a
glance with that complete deathlike indifference of unhappy savages
behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed the product of the new
forces at work strolled despondently carrying a rifle by its middle
he had a uniform jacket with one button off and seeing a white man on
the path hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity this was
simple prudence white men being so much alike at a distance that he
could not tell who i might be he was speedily reassured and with a
large white rascally grin and a glance at his charge seemed to take
me into partnership in his exalted trust after all i also was a part
of the great cause of these high and just proceedings

instead of going up i turned and descended to the left my idea was to
let that chain-gang get out of sight before i climbed the hill you know
i am not particularly tender ive had to strike and to fend off
ive had to resist and to attack sometimes thats only one way of
resisting without counting the exact cost according to the demands
of such sort of life as i had blundered into ive seen the devil of
violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by
all the stars! these were strong lusty red-eyed devils that swayed
and drove men men i tell you but as i stood on this hillside i
foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become
acquainted with a flabby pretending weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and
pitiless folly how insidious he could be too i was only to find out
several months later and a thousand miles farther for a moment i
stood appalled as though by a warning finally i descended the hill
obliquely towards the trees i had seen

i avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the
slope the purpose of which i found it impossible to divine it wasnt
a quarry or a sandpit anyhow it was just a hole it might have
been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals
something to do i dont know then i nearly fell into a very narrow
ravine almost no more than a scar in the hillside i discovered that
a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in
there there wasnt one that was not broken it was a wanton smash-up
at last i got under the trees my purpose was to stroll into the shade
for a moment but no sooner within than it seemed to me i had stepped
into the gloomy circle of some inferno the rapids were near and an
uninterrupted uniform headlong rushing noise filled the mournful
stillness of the grove where not a breath stirred not a leaf moved
with a mysterious sound as though the tearing pace of the launched
earth had suddenly become audible

black shapes crouched lay sat between the trees leaning against the
trunks clinging to the earth half coming out half effaced within
the dim light in all the attitudes of pain abandonment and despair
another mine on the cliff went off followed by a slight shudder of the
soil under my feet the work was going on the work! and this was the
place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die

they were dying slowly it was very clear they were not enemies they
were not criminals they were nothing earthly now nothing but black
shadows of disease and starvation lying confusedly in the greenish
gloom brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality
of time contracts lost in uncongenial surroundings fed on unfamiliar
food they sickened became inefficient and were then allowed to crawl
away and rest these moribund shapes were free as air and nearly as
thin i began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees
then glancing down i saw a face near my hand the black bones reclined
at full length with one shoulder against the tree and slowly the
eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me enormous and vacant
a kind of blind white flicker in the depths of the orbs which died out
slowly the man seemed young almost a boy but you know with them its
hard to tell i found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good
swedes ships biscuits i had in my pocket the fingers closed slowly
on it and held there was no other movement and no other glance he had
tied a bit of white worsted round his neck why? where did he get it?
was it a badge an ornament a charm a propitiatory act? was there any
idea at all connected with it? it looked startling round his black neck
this bit of white thread from beyond the seas

near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs
drawn up one with his chin propped on his knees stared at nothing
in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its
forehead as if overcome with a great weariness and all about others
were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse as in some picture
of a massacre or a pestilence while i stood horror-struck one of these
creatures rose to his hands and knees and went off on all-fours towards
the river to drink he lapped out of his hand then sat up in the
sunlight crossing his shins in front of him and after a time let his
woolly head fall on his breastbone

i didnt want any more loitering in the shade and i made haste towards
the station when near the buildings i met a white man in such an
unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment i took him for
a sort of vision i saw a high starched collar white cuffs a light
alpaca jacket snowy trousers a clean necktie and varnished boots no
hat hair parted brushed oiled under a green-lined parasol held in a
big white hand he was amazing and had a penholder behind his ear

i shook hands with this miracle and i learned he was the companys
chief accountant and that all the book-keeping was done at this
station he had come out for a moment he said to get a breath of
fresh air the expression sounded wonderfully odd with its suggestion
of sedentary desk-life i wouldnt have mentioned the fellow to you at
all only it was from his lips that i first heard the name of the
man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time
moreover i respected the fellow yes i respected his collars his
vast cuffs his brushed hair his appearance was certainly that of a
hairdressers dummy but in the great demoralization of the land he
kept up his appearance thats backbone his starched collars and got-up
shirt-fronts were achievements of character he had been out nearly
three years and later i could not help asking him how he managed to
sport such linen he had just the faintest blush and said modestly
ive been teaching one of the native women about the station it was
difficult she had a distaste for the work thus this man had verily
accomplished something and he was devoted to his books which were in
apple-pie order
