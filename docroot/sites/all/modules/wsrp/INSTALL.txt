1) unzip the module under a valid drupal modules directory.
2) Enable the module from Modules
3) Configure Consumer name and producers you want to connect to 
   from Configuration -> WEB SERVICES -> WSRP
   
   For example you can add this test producer:
   
   Producer Name: NetUnity v2
   Producer WSDL url: http://www.netunitysoftware.com/wsrp2interop/wsrpproducer.asmx?Operation=WSDL&WsrpVersion=Two
   Producer WSRP version: 2.0
   
4) OK now you can creaate Nodes and blocks referencing WSRP portlets:
    4.1) go to Structure -> blocks (you will see the portlets as blocks 
         to position on your theme)
    4.2) go to Content -> add content -> WSRP node and create a node based on a WSRP Portlet
    
enjoy

ps: The module is written for WSRP 2.0 and will get support for WSRP 1.0 as a secondary item
