#Administration pane

Administration pane is a supplement to the core Toolbar that adds a pane to the
right side of the screen containing one or more of your sites menus. The module
also displays the current local tasks above the menu. Administration pane
integrates visually with the core Toolbar.

##Installation

  1.  Place the admin_pane module folder in "sites/all/modules".

  2.  Download jsTree jQuery addon from http://www.jstree.com/, extract
      the archive and place the resulting folder in:
      "sites/all/modules/admin_pane/jstree" so that the full path to
      the jquery.jstree.js file becomes
      "sites/all/modules/admin_pane/jstree/jquery.jstree.js".

  3. Enable the module via Drupal's administration interface.
