  OVERVIEW
-----------------------
Generates a toolbar (aka dropdown menu) from a custom menu. Visible only to 
selected roles.

For site administrators and developers, there is the excellent module 
"admin_menu". The structure of this menu is however not ideal production-wise.
Guys that work with adding content on a regular basis would do better with a 
menu structured to match their needs. Needs however vary from site to site 
- hence there is a need for a fully customizable toolbar.

If you wish, you can also enable the menu for anonymous users as a quick way of
creating a dropdown site navigation. Its not the use-case the module was build
for, but its possible...

  INSTALLATION
-----------------------

1. Create a new custom menu, ie "Webmaster menu", and add items such as 
   "Create page", "Find pages", "Translation overview". - Whatever suits you.
2. Install the module (upload it to site/modules folder, and enable it on the 
   modules page)
3. Go to the config page of this module and set it to use the new menu. You 
   also specify which roles should see it. There is a link to the config page
   on the module list. The path is: admin/config/webmaster_menu
