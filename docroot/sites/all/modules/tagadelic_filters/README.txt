This module adds a configurable number of blocks which display tag clouds as
the Tagadelic module does. The difference here is the link path is configurable
and is intended to use for prepopulating Views Exposed Filters. It may also be
desirable to use CSS, or Better Exposed Filters, to hide the exposed filter and 
use just the tag cloud to filter the view.
