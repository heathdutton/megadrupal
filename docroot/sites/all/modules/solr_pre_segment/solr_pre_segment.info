name = Solr pre-segment search words
description = Chinese, Japanese and Korean words are not separated by space. If we can invoke Solr (with CJK word-segmentation tools configured) to pre-segment the search keywords, and then re-invoke the Solr to search the segmented words, the search result will be much better. This module applies to this situation.
