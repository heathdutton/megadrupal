DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides an additional formatter for image core field,
to link to an image style.


INSTALLATION
------------

1) Place this module directory in your "modules" folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/"). Don't install your module in Drupal core's "modules"
   folder, since that will cause problems and is bad practice in general. If
   "sites/all/modules" doesn't exist yet, just create it.

2) Enable the module.
