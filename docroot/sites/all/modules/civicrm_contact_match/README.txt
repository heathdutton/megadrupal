This module provides an easy way to change the Drupal user
to CiviCRM contact associations through the Drupal user page.

Tested with CiviCRM 4.4 releases.

== Usage ==
The module adds a CiviCRM Contact Match tab to the user page (/user/<uid>)
which lets you modify the CiviCRM contact ID that this user is associated with.
It also provides a link to the CiviCRM contact
(if the CiviCRM location has been set in the module settings).
