WHAT DOES MENU LANGUAGE MODULE DO?
=============================

This module enables you to have an clear overview per language what the menu
entries are. In Drupal all of these links are on the same page and thus
it is not clear in which language it is and the menus will grow 
very big in time aswell.

You will be able to select which menus will be editable by this module.
(configuration part)

After you have selected which menus you want to be editable, these menus
will be visible separated by language.

This will provide a better overview for customers with bigger menus or
for a multi lingual approach.

at admin/structure/
for example : admin/structure/main-menu-nl
