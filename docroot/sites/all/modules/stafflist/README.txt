Staff List
----------
The staff list module lets you use the user roles of users to generate a staff list.
To enable the module, go to Administer => Site Building => Modules.

From Administer => Site Configuration => Staff List, you can associate user roles
with staff information.  A role can either designate a department or a level
withing a department (e.g.: Editor, Staff).

Users who have both a 'department' role and a 'level' role will appear on the
staff list.

The staff list is a top-level menu item.  To change its location, go to
Administer => Site Building => Menus.
