Gmail Contact module is for Drupal integration with Gmail Contact API.

============ Installment =============

Before enable/install this module, one google app is required:

-- Go to Google developer console to create one app.
-- Enable Contact API.
-- Add your test/production sites domain and redirect url there.
-- One redirect url required by this module is '/initiate-gmail-invite'.
-- While token module (https://www.drupal.org/project/token) is not required
   for this module, it is encouraged to install token module to gain the
   flexibility of Gmail contact configuration.
-- Assign this permission "Access Gmail Contact invite page" to roles that
   can use this Gmail invitation function.
-- Configure this block 'Gmail Invite Block' to display at theme. Then
   users can start to invite gmail contacts by clicking the invite link
   inside this block.

============ Usage ===================

The main purpose of this module is to allow site users send emails to their
Gmail contacts, e.g, send message to contacts to invite them to your site.

There's one built-in block in this module "Gmail Invite Block". Configure this
block to display at one region. Then users can click the link inside the block
to invite their gmail contacts.

For security reason: You may want to add visibility control for that block.
For example, only show this block for 'authenticated user', in which case,
anonymous users won't see this block and won't be able to send invitation.

============ Configuration ===========

After enable this module, configure this module at
'admin/structure/gmail_contact'.

Add Gmail App info and various invitation settings there.

One notable setting is "Send emails using drupal queue". If you check this
option, the invitation emails will not be sent immediately. Instead, all
emails will be added to drupal queue, and sent later. This is useful when users
want to send hundreds of emails to gmail contacts in one time.

Note: if Google service is banned at your country, such as China, this module
won't work unless you and your customers use VPN to go through GFW.

=========== Development =============

You may want to develop your own application with Gmail Contact API.
There are some helper functions in this module you can make use of.
See 'Helper Function' flag at gmail_contact.module.
