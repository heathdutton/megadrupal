  (Added README.txt)
* by adamdicarlo: Update PageFlip to latest client code. Adds several features,
  code clean-ups, and bugfixes:
  * Mobile device (iPad, iPhone, and iPod) detection that automatically uses
    the low-resolution HTML Viewer.
  * Configurable help message to show to mobile device users.
  * Token module support, and XML-rendered [page-content] token in mz3 viewer.
  * Ability to indicate desired resolution for HTML viewer by way of an
    additional argument that can be "low" or "high".
  * Better, shorter, and easier to work with code for loading books.
  * Wrapped JavaScript so it won't fail if $ != jQuery.
  * Have pageflip module get viewer settings and pass them along, to reduce
    duplicate code in viewer modules.
  * Bugfix: HTML Viewer pages weren't being wrapped properly with anchors

  Some markup/CSS changes were made to facilitate using, for example, the
  voting widget more than once on the same page (outside of the HTML
  viewer)--so some CSS ids became classes.
