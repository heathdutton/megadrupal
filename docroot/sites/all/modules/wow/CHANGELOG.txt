WoW API 7.x-2.0 Changelog since 7.x-1.x

 - WoW API:
   - wow_http_request no longer requires $langcode parameter; This was redundant
   with $query['locale'] parameter.
   - wow_http_request now returns a WoWHttpResponse object; This is mainly for
   methods that uses it to set the request timestamp, region used, and locale.
   - Changed the WoWHttpException object: getMessage will now return the status
   returned by the API.
   - Removed wow_locale_default and wow_region_default variables.
   
 - WoW Realm:
   - entity related methods are now deprecated in favore of using Entity system.
   
 - WoW Character:
   - entity related methods are now deprecated in favore of using Entity system.
   - Only css related to character colors are kept. Other properties has been
   deleted.
   - wow_character_classes and wow_character_races works differently. Either you
   provides a language to get all available information, either you provide a
   wow_character entity to get the class info associated.
