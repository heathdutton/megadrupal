MakeUp Box
==========

Maintainer: w3wfr (<drupal@w3w.fr>)

MakeUp Box is a utility module shared by other MakeUp modules.

### Notice: 

 * This module is useless by itself.

### A global approach

Beyond this very module, MakeUp is a collection of small modules which expect a better use of Formatters and View mode level.

Formatters are consistent in many contexts:

 * View mode
 * Views
 * Panels

As a consequene, they provide the best continued UX throughout the site in Drupal.

They export through Features however complex they can be.

They are very Drupal native, and have low performance overhead.
