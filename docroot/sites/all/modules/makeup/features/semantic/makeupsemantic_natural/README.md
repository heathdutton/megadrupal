Maintainer: w3wfr (<drupal@w3w.fr>)

MakeUp Semantic Natural is a Feature that provides presets for Semantic Fields.

### Notice: 

 * This module is a Feature.
 * See MakeUp Semantic Bootstrap to benefits Semantic Fields presets for Bootstrap.

### Features

Natively, Drupal generate *a lot* of tags around fields while talented HTML integrators usually deliver much lighter templates. This Feature use Semantic Fields to clean up Drupal generated HTML code.

Using Semantic Fields helps override less templates and `theme_()` functions: these need to be overriden at Theme level while **these HTML tags are most of time *not* design dependent, but bundle dependent**.

MakeUp Semantic Natural provides 8 Semantic Fields presets: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7 and None.

These presets are very light. *None* preset makes sure **no tag** is around the field.
