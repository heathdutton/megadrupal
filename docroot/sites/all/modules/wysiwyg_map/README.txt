INTRODUCTION
------------

Current Maintainer: Scot Hubbard - http://drupal.org/user/868214

This module allows content creators/maintainers to add maps to content via
the TinyMCE & CKEditor WYSIWYG editors (it has been tested against these 
two editors, it may also work with others).

A WYSIWYG toolbar button can be enabled under the WYSIWYG profiles setup 
to allow the user to open a dialog that will enabled them to find a point 
on a map, set the width, height and zoom factor and map type, and insert 
a token directly into the filtered content. The map will then display 
when the content is viewed normally.

It is also necessary to enable to filter under Text Formats (this will 
convert the token into the corresponding map when the content is veiwed 
normally).  Make sure the WYSIWYG Map Filter is one of the last to run.
