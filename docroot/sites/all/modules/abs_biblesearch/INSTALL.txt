To install the module:
1) Install and enable the libraries module (http://drupal.org/project/libraries)
2) Install and enable the fancybox module (http://drupal.org/project/fancybox).  This will require you to download the fancybox javascript library.  Look at the fancybox instructions for details on where to get this, and where to put it.
3) Go to https://bitbucket.org/absits/bible-search-api-php-library/, click on the "get source" button on the right side, and select an archive type you are comfortable working with to download the ABS Biblesearch php library.  This should be placed in sites/all/libraries/abs_biblesearch.
4) Getan API key (for free) and enter it in the ABS Biblesearch config page.  NOTE that the module WILL NOT WORK until you provide an American Bible Society Bible Search API Key.  The key is free, and signup is simple.  Signup by going to http://biblesearch.americanbible.org/pages/api/signup.  If you'd like additional information about the API you can find that at http://biblesearch.americanbible.org/pages/api.

The api key should be entered in the ABS Biblesearch Settings admin page, after which your module will be active.

The module provides to new blocks that you can display anywhere on your site that accepts blocks.  The blocks are called ABS Bible Search Form and ABS Bible Search Results.  They can be placed on the same page, or on different pages.  If you would like you can make sure that all results are only shown on one page, by providing a results page path in the module settings page.
