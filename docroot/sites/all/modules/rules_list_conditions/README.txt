Rules_list_conditions provides loops in conditions for the Rules module.

Rules_list_conditions provides two kinds of loops in conditions ANY and ALL.

ANY evaluates to TRUE when the loop body evaluates to TRUE for any item in a
list.

ALL evaluates to TRUE when the loop body evaluates to TRUE for all items in a
list.

There will be + Add any and + Add all links at the bottom of the Conditions
section in Rules UI after enabling this module.
