What is Acobot
---------------

Acobot is a D.I.Y. customer support automation platform, with which you can 
create your very own live chat robot for business or just for fun.

It takes less than 3 minutes to get Acobot on to your website. Then your robot 
will

* Greet visitors to your website.
* Answer their questions instantly.
* Address their concerns, with a human touch.
* Collect their email addresses or phone numbers.
* Bring them to the right web pages (pushing page).
* And turn themm into paying customers like never before.

She is fully automated in interacting with website visitors. This means she 
will work for you even when you go to the beach.

IMPORATANT: Acobot is designed to chat in English. The robot does NOT work with
any other languages. Sorry but she's too busy to study foreign langauges at 
this time.

What does this module do
------------------------

You can install Acobot on your Drupal site through theme or blick system. It is 
pretty simple and easy.

Still we created this module to make the installation even easier. The module 
come with the features below.

  automatically sent to your robot.
