Upgading from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7
-----------------------------------

1. Before attempting to upgrade matrix, take note of the settings for each field. This migration will migrate the saved date but not
   any field settings. These will need to be readded by hand.
2. Install the CCK module (http://drupal.org/project/cck) and enable the CCK and Content Migrate modules.
3. By default, the migration path is for Matrix 1.x, to migrate from Matrix 2.x alter the 16th line in migrate.inc
   from "$field_value['type'] = 'matrix_text';" to "$field_value['type'] = 'matrix_custom';"
   NB. upgrading from 2.x is not officially supported.
4. Go to "Structure" >> "Migrate fields" and choose the matrix fields you wish to upgrade.
5. After the upgrade edit each matrix field ("Structure" >> "Content Types" >> <Content type> >> "Manage Fields"
   Choose the "Widget Type" tab and save.
   Edit the field and re-enter the settings from step 1.
