DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Allows users of module regcode to automatically add organic groups to users 
depending on regcode categories. This module works analogous to regcode_roles.

INSTALLATION
---------------
- Install Organic Groups Module (og)
- Install regcode module
- Install this module
- Visit admin/user/regcodes/ogs and start managing rules

NOTES
----------------
- This module allows users to become members of organic groups. It circumvents 
the organic group restriction to confirm new members of groups, because 
members should not be confirmed twice. First by giving them a code and second 
by confirmation again.
