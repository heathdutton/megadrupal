What Is Fastly?
---------------

Fastly is a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which is to say, we speed up
delivery of your website and its content to your users. When your client in
Moscow, Montana or Vriezenveen, Netherlands clicks on your site requesting
a piece of information, we want them to feel your speed of delivery. No
waiting. We want them to get to your closest point of presence—in
milliseconds—to get what they want.

Founded in 2011 Fastly delivers the world's only real-time content delivery
network. At Fastly we think slow is unacceptable. Fastly enables a
next-generation of businesses to give their users the best online and mobile
experience. The patent-pending Fastly Caching Software delivers static,
dynamic and streaming content with the lowest recorded time to first byte.
Our customers include (but certainly aren't limited to) Twitter, Guardian
UK, GitHub, AddThis, Wikia, Shazam, Wanelo, and Yammer.

Fastly is a San Francisco based company, located in the heart of SOMA.
We are venture backed by Battery Ventures, OATV, August Capital, and Amplify
Partners. We provide challenging work, opportunities to learn, high-quality
teammates and, most importantly, we have a lot of fun doing what we love.
We offer some great benefits like a Tahoe ski cabin, stocked fridge,
flexible schedules, lots of company happy hours, and a no-vacation policy.
We are close to MUNI and BART, and Caltrain is just a pleasant 15-minute stroll.

We offer competitive compensation, stock options, and health benefits.

SSL and Fastly
--------------
Fastly can support SSL connections.
See http://docs.fastly.com/guides/21844521/23340542 for a list of different
options available.
If you are using SSL, you should add the following lines of code to your
settings.php

// Enable Faslty SSL connections.
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_FASTLY_SSL']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_FASTLY_SSL']) {
  $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
}

Expire Module Integration
-------------------------
The Faslty module has integration with the Cache Expiration module
(https://www.drupal.org/project/expire).

You can enable this by visiting admin/config/system/expire.  You should see
Fastly in the list of modules that support external expiration.
Make sure you select "External expiration".

To alter the purged URLs or add additional URLs, such as URLs on other domains,
implement hook_expire_urls_alter() in a custom module. If you tick "Include base
URL in expires", the absolute URL being purged will be passed into this hook.

Custom VCL
----------
Fastly gives you the ability to upload and use your own VCL file.
This needs to be enabled by contacting Fastly support and requesting it.

This module contains an example.vcl file, this is intended to be used with a
Drupal site running on Fastly.  It contains session cookie handling logic,
as well as excluding certain paths from being cached.

If you need to edit the VCL file for whatever reason, please be aware of the
following thing:
* Fastly uses Varnish 2, there are some differences in syntax between 2 and 3.
* Do not include any host information in the VCL, this is added later by Fastly.

HTTPRL Module
-------------
This module supports the HTTP Parallel Request & Threading Library module
(https://www.drupal.org/project/httprl). If installed and enabled, this module
can issue PURGE requests without waiting for a response from Fastly.
