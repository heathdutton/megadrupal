Overview
--------
An interface for creating surveys and quizzes that use a shared repository of
questions based on the form_builder module. Surveys and questions are
stored as entities that can be used in views. A sample view of surveys is
provided by the survey_builder_ui module.


Usage
-----
Enable the  "Survey Builder UI" module then navigate to survey/new to create a
new survey. Once questions have been added and the survey has been
saved a new "Add existing question" block will become visible allowing 
previously created questions to be inserted in later surveys.
