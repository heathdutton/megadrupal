Checkbox filter
===============

This module provides a textbox to narrow down long lists of checkboxes. Just type a few characters, and only checkboxes containing the characters will be shown.

Make sure you have the 'show checkbox filter' permission, and set the pages where you want the filter the appear in the module settings:

/admin/settings/checkbox_filter

This is handy to search through Views fields or filters, long lists of modules or variables in Features and Strongarm etc.

It currently does NOT work for modules or permissions. For modules, use the Module Filter:

For permissions, Filter Permissions:

http://drupal.org/project/filter_perms
