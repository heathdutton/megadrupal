----------------------------

1. Place the contents of the tarball (or CVS checkout) in your sites/xxx/modules/wishlist directory.

2. Enable the wishlist module under Administer > Site building > Modules.  This will install the 
   database tables.  

4. Grant the proper access to user accounts under Administer > User management >
   Permissions.
   
5. Optionally enable the Wishlists block.  The block will only appear after wishlist
   nodes have been created.

If your theme includes blocks on the right hand side of the display, I highly recommend removing
them for wishlist/*.  The wishlist table view is wide.
