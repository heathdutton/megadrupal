INTRODUCTION

Current Maintainer: Sami Radi a.k.a VirtuoWorks <http://drupal.org/user/656630>

Remove Duplicates removes duplicate nodes
according to any selected content field.

This can be very useful with Drupal feeds module :
- http://drupal.org/project/feeds

This module was inspired by these threads : 
- http://drupal.org/node/720190 : Remove Duplicate Nodes based on title
- http://drupal.org/node/1211922 : remove duplicated node base on title problem

THANKS
------

Thanks to dman <https://drupal.org/user/33240> for endorsing this project.

He wrote a sandbox module "Deduplicate Nodes" for D6 intended to deduplicate
nodes according to titles only : https://drupal.org/sandbox/dman/1422586

INSTALLING
----------

See http://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib
for instructions on how to install or update Drupal modules.

Once Remove Duplicates is installed and enabled,
you can use it at admin/config/content/remove_duplicates.

It is highly recommended that you backup your database before using this module.

UNINSTALLING
------------

Because Drupal does not uninstall modules in reverse 
order of their dependencies, if you want to uninstall
all the Remove Duplicates modules, be sure to disable 
and uninstall all the sub-modules before the base Remove 
Duplicates module.

To help fix this bug in Drupal core, visit http://drupal.org/node/151452.
