This module adds two permissions and removes them from the "Administer Users" permission that is now part of Core.

It adds:
Administer User Settings - (like updating email templates etc...)
and
Access to change the admin role

So after enabling this module if a role is set to "Administer Users" they do not automatically get permission to Administer User Settings 
(like updating email templates etc...) and Access to change the admin role. 
They only get permission to do the other things that are part of Administer Users.
