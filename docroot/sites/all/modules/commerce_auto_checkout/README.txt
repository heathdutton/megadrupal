Commerce Auto-Checkout
----------------------
This module allows sites to make visitors automatically from the Commerce cart
page to the checkout page; this can simplify the visitor's experience going
through the cart checkout process.

By default Drupal Commerce will redirect a visitor from the checkout page to
the homepage (or another page defined by the commerce_checkout_empty_redirect
variable) if their cart is empty, so an option is provided allowing a default
product to be added to their cart should it be otherwise empty.


Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module requires various submodules of the Drupal Commerce module [1]. While
it works best when paired with the Commerce Cart Form Checkout Pane module [2],
it is not specifically required.
