******************************************************************** 

Read the aes install.txt file for REQUIREMENTS. 
In a nutshell, I recommand to install the Mcrypt php Extension 
on your server for great performance. 

******************************************************************** 
INSTALLATION: 

0. PAY ATTENTION : Proceed first to a full backup of your database, 
especially the user table : it is going to be updated. If it goes wrong, 
those datas could be lost forever ! 

1. navigate to "Administer â€º Site building > modules", Install AES 
module, available on http://drupal.org/project/aes 

2. install the DataBase Email Encryption module. At that time, the 
emails are now encrypted. 

Recommanded settings : 3. Go on the AES settings page (admin/settings/aes)
as super-administrator (user1) or as a user with appropriate permissions 
("administer aes") : On the "Key storage method:" field : select "file", 
On the "Path to keyfile:" field : enter a folder outside the webroot, 
for example it could be something like "./../key.pwd", depending where 
you have installed the drupal folder on your server. 

4. By default, AES module enable its primary goal : it makes user 
password readables. If you don't need this feature, uncheck "Create AES 
passwords" and save. Note : and the 1.5 AES version (and older versions), 
the password feature will be automatically disable because it may be 
reponsible of issues.

5. Keep a copy of the encryption key in a secure location. The 
encryption key should be stored into the file key.pwd or whatever you 
named it. In case of remote server website installation, an FTP software 
would be required. 

******************************************************************** 
MAINTENANCE: 

When you procced to regular database backup of your website, be careful 
to save both database AND the file that contains the encryption key.

ABOUT CUSTOM MODULES COMPATIBILITY: 

The dataBase Email Encryption module is compatible with drupal core. 
Thanks to various hooks, most custom modules should be compatible with 
the DataBase Email Encryption (dbee). Some won't be comptatible or may 
need, usually, fast adjustments by a drupal developper (thoses 
adjustements may be written directly into the dbee module). As an 
example, thanks to provided fixes included into the dbee module, the 
dbee module is natively compatible with the custom modules : 
- "Email Registration" (http://drupal.org/project/email_registration)
- "logintoboggan" (http://drupal.org/project/logintoboggan)
If you experiment compatibility issues with some custom modules, please 
report thoses issues on http://drupal.org/project/issues/dbee, as I may 
fix them.
