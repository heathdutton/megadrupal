## Lagotto Services

## Sandbox 2014-12-15

Initial Features:
 - Admin interface to define URLs, keys and access.
 - Checking and verification of DOI format.
 - Rules actions to add or remove a DOI from the server.
 - Support for fetching information for an array of DOIs in one call.
 - Can disable & enable article changes independently of user role.
 - Built-in sanitisation of the DOI identifier with automatic removal of doi:
   and http://dx.doi.org prefixes.

## Sandbox 2015-01-27

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed inappropriate call on status page.
 - Extended API test cases.
 - Adjust web test case so it fails with an understandable error if no server
   or key has been defined in it.

Additions:
 - Added simple example block in a sub-module to demonstrate operation.
 - Improve the API around decoding the results of a query. In particular,
   always return arrays, not objects (so you don't have to worry whether
   it is an array or not).


## Project 1.0

Bug Fixes:
 - Two additional check_plain() calls in block example.


## Project dev

Bug Fixes:
 - Simpletest test fixes
 - lagotto_services_records() more carefully checks reply.

Improvements:
 - support for drush lookup of ids
 - support for PubMed, PubMed Central IDs as well as DOIs. Default
   is still DOI. Function names change to remove 'doi' unless that is still
   appropriate.
