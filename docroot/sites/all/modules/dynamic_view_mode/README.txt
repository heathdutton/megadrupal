Dynamic View Mode
=================

This module creates a "dynamic" view mode that gets replaced by a view mode specified in the node edit form.

How is this useful?
For example, to create views of nodes that display with different layouts.

A similar functionality is provided by Display Suite Extras module, but that only works when the entity is displayed on
its full-page view. This module does not alter the full-page view mode (it creates a new one) and it does not depend on
Display Suite.
