Alfred 2 workflows have to be packaged in a certain way that isn't supported
inside drupal.org projects.

To correctly package and install this Alfred 2 workflow open a terminal in this
directory and execute the following command:
./package.sh


Once the command has run you can delete this directory as it's no longer
required.
