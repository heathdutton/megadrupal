Custom add content page
=======================

This module allows you to customize the "add content" page by converting
it to a hierarchical menu named "Custom add content page". By configuring
this menu you will be able to:

a) Sort creation links and establish a hierarchy
b) Hide creation links

Via module's administration page you can choose a menu renderer between:

a) Drupal's core renderer
b) Module's custom renderer (default): Replicates core add content page
   but it allows you to define a hierarchy

When a content type is created or deleted the menu is automatically updated.
