Lyris for Drupal, v2.x - Installation and Configuration
================================================================================
This module utilizes Lyris's SOAP API to interact with an existing Lyris server.

+ Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, Lyris's API is open on port 82 so your webserver will need access
to that port.

The module is built to be compatible with Lyris API versions 1.5.2a, 10.x and
11.x.

+ Lyris Admins and Drupal Users
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a user on your site to interact with the Lyris server above simply
(un)subscribing to a list, the user will need an account on Lyris with at least
List Admin permissions.  Credentials for a Lyris Server Admin will be stored in
the settings.php file to handle basic administrative requests such as pulling
data from Lyris. (See Installation step 3.)

For any roles that should be allowed to manage any Lyris settings, enable the
'access lyris api' permission.  This will allow them to to provide a Lyris
username and password so they can interact with the Lyris server.

NOTE: Their access level on the site will be limited to that of their Lyris
admin account.

Example:
- If Billy is the Lyris List Admin for the madison_hotels_staff mailing
list, then this is the only list he will see on the site in the administration
pages.
- Carl, however, as a Lyris Site Admin for Madison Hotels will be able to
import any list in the Madison Hotels Lyris topic (site), create new lists on
that site and manage members of those lists.  He does not have access, though,
to any lists outside of this Lyris site.
- Brian, as the CEO of Madison Hotels, is a Server Admin for the Lyris Server
and can do whatever he wants.

+ Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Place this module into your site's modules directory (usually
   sites/[site-name|all]/modules or sites/[site-name|all]/contrib/modules).
2. Enable the Lyris module either through the Modules Administration page or
   with Drush.  This is all you need to get started.
3. In the settings.php file, add the following code to provide your site with
   server level permissions to Lyris.
   
  $conf['lyris_connection'] = array(
    'sandbox' => array(
      'admin_name' => 'SandboxAdminUser',
      'admin_pass'  => 'password',
    ),
    'production' => array(
      'admin_name' => 'ProdAdminUser',
      'admin_pass'  => 'password',
    ),
  );

4. As an administrator, your roll should be granted the 'access lyris api'
   permission, which allows users to provide a Lyris username and password so
   they can interact with the Lyris server.  This is found under your site's
   user account settings.
