The Hall of Fame ("hof") module currently uses the following cascading
stylesheet elements:

class="hof"               This is in a <DIV> tag around the module's page output.

class="hof_embedded_toc"  This surrounds the embedded table-of-contents (but
                          not the full-page TOC).

By default, neither of these style elements appears in a CSS file, so they have
no effect. You can define these in your custom theme or CSS file to affect the
appearance of the Hall of Fame pages.

Other style elements may be added in future versions to allow finer-grained
control.
