Initial work to port to Drupal 7. Code is alpha-level and not yet
working completely, but it's a start.

2008-12-18	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Deleted closing PHP tag at end of main module file, per Drupal
coding standards. First supported release for Drupal 6.

Added friendlier names for node types by looking up the names from
the {node_type} table.

in issue #347037.

Drupal 6 port released for beta. Added warning messages in the popular
content section that indicate if the Statistics module is disabled or
is not configured to count node reads.

2008-12-07	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Initial port to Drupal 6, alpha version. No errors reported, but some
of the report sections are not yet producing useful output. Definitely
do NOT deploy to a production site.

2008-12-07	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Added Slovak translation kindly provided by "havran".

2007-03-22	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Ported module to Drupal 5.x. Some of the Spanish translation may
be outdated, but most of it should still be correct.

2006-07-13	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Added Spanish translation file kindly contributed by Federico
Scodelaro (Drupal user "fscodelaro"). Thanks, Federico!

2006-02-03	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Updated to use Drupal 4.7 forms API.

Various changes to prompt text. The translations will unfortunately
need to be updated at some point.

Added new section to report all published nodes by node type.

Added reporting of never-activated and disabled user accounts.

Modified handling of image nodes so that they can be included or
excluded from totals at the discretion of the site admin.

2005-11-03	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Applied patch contributed by "frjo" for better XHTML compliance, improved
code readability, and improved handling of moderation flag in nodes.
Patch was slightly modified to correct minor SQL issues. Nonetheless,
this was a significant patch -- many thanks to "frjo" for the contrib!
This relates to issue #28898.

Fixed a PHP 5 compatibility problem (no issue number applicable).

Added file upload statistics, as suggested by "rosa" in issue #25059.

2005-05-06	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Modified placement of t() calls to fix bug #22186 reported by Cvbge.

2005-05-02	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Added curly brackets around table names so prefixes will work right.
Fixes bug #21726. Patch by "ejort" (thanks!).

2005-04-28	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Moved creation of interval constants later in page creation process,
to fix crash in situations where t() function wasn't yet defined.
(Fixes bug #21495)

2005-04-14	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Added translation of time interval strings. (Fixes bug #20482)

2005-04-13	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Use l() function instead of hard-coded HTML links. (Fixes bug #20406)

2005-04-12	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Modified SQL query to use db_query_range() instead of hard-coded "LIMIT"
keyword, which might not work with all databases.

Fixed display of embedded table-of-contents menu on sub-pages.

Added an admin setting to keep the embedded TOC from displaying a link to
the full TOC. This link was redundant in certain themes for certain settings
of HOF itself; the new setting allows the admin to disable it in these
cases.

2005-03-27	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Reformatted code to remove tab indentation, per Drupal coding standards.

2005-03-27	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Program is feature-complete and ready for beta testing. Known to work with
Drupal 4.6, probably works with 4.5 as well but has not been tested with that
version yet.

2005-03-26	syscrusher (Scott Courtney)

Initial release of alpha test version
