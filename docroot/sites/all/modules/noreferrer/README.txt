REFERRER POLICY
===============

The rel="noreferrer" attribute[1] indicates that no referrer information is to
be leaked when following the link.

This module adds a rel="noreferrer" attribute to all external links generated by
the theme layer.

It also provides a filter which, if enabled for a text format, adds a
rel="noreferrer" attribute to all external links in user-generated content.

If metatag module[2] is installed, you may also want to enable the meta referrer
element[3] to set a referrer policy[4] for the page.
