                                =============


-- SUMMARY --
  ---------

PMB Connector allows to link PMB/PhpMyBibli, a free (except easy access to old
and new code) library management system (LMS/ILS), to Drupal through a
webservice (currently JSON-RPC).

With this module, users can browse and search inside the catalog of the library
from Drupal. Readers can access to their loans, reservations and reading lists
from the CMS.

Current release of PMB/PhpMyBibli can be downloaded here at http://www.pmbservices.fr/nouveau_site/telecharger_inter.html.
