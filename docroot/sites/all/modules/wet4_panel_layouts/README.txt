-- SUMMARY --

The Web Experience Toolkit 4 (WET_BOEW) panel layouts module is part of a suite
that implements the Web Experience Toolkit v4.x front-end framework into Drupal.
The framework, lead by the Government of Canada, is open-source and
collaborative, and is made to be accessible, mobile, and responsive. You can
find the full documentation here: http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index.html.

The Web Experience Toolkit distribution (https://www.drupal.org/project/wetkit)
is a content management system. If you prefer an out-of-the-box system, please
refer to the distribution.

This suite is meant for site builders who prefer to have a bit more control and
provides a simple roadmap for upgrading WET components. By decoupling the
features and leveraging Drupalâ€™s module and theming system, we are able to
provide quicker theme updates and keep the WET overhead low.

This module Implements a variety of accessible and responsive layouts leveraging 
the WET grid system.
