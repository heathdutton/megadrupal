With the module activated, you now have a new category you could choose from,
Entity list. To insert a list of nodes on a panechoose Node entity list.
You now have some settings you could do. Your content type must have the view
mode you choose for it activated, else it will just use the default.
With Display Suite or some other modules, or with code, you could create your
own view modes.

With Context you could choose to show nodes from just on one taxonomy term, or
created by a user. User Context is for now supported for Taxonomy Term and User.

* Use ajax or jQuery to make just the view modes availble that you could use
for the node type.
* Make it awesome.
