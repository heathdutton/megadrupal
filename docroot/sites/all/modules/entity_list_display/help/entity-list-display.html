  <h1>Entity List Display</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
Entity list display is a ctools-plugin that displays lists of content with a
view mode.
  </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
ctools http://drupal.org/project/ctools
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Normal Drupal module installation, see
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
for further information.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
After you have activated the module you could use it on a panel page.
Set up your page, add content to a pane.
To insert a list of nodes on a pane choose Entity List
Display -  node from the category Widgets. You now have some settings 
you could do. Your content type must have the view mode you choose for it
activated, else it will just use the default. With Display Suite or some other 
modules, or with code, you could create your own view modes.
</p>
<h3>Ctools Context</h3>
<p>You can use Taxonomy Term and User context with Entity List Display.
</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>You want to list all content from the content type Receipe with the taxonomy
  term 'Pasta'. In Page manager you add Taxonomy term in the
  configuration of contexts (menu tab Contexts). In the settigs you choose the
  taxonomy term 'Pasta'. Add a the name 'pasta' as the Identifier (that
  is what you are going to choose later on the configuration of Entity List
  Display). You could also ad a keyword. Click finish. Go to tab for Content.
  Add content -> Widgets -> Entity List Display. Choose 'pasta'. Choose content
  type Receipe, Number of posts: 5, View mode: teaser. Click Finish. Save.
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>
* Use ajax or jQuery to make just the view modes availble that you could use
for the node type.
* Make it awesome
