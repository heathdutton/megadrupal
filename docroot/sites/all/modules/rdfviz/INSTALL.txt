== Permissions ==

Access to the RDF Visualizations is moderated by the permission "Access RDFViz"
Remember to turn that on if you want normal users to see the outputs.

== PHP ARC2 Library ==

This is required to parse the RDF(a) data out of web pages.
You will need to download it from http://github.com/semsol/arc2
and extract it into Drupals libraries folder as
  /sites/all/libraries/arc
such that the main file can be found in:
  /sites/all/libraries/arc/ARC2.php

If you are using RDFx.module, it provides an auto-installation tool via drush.

== PEAR Libraries (Image_Graphviz ==

This requires some PEAR libraries.
If you don't have Pear already on your system, and you can't install it
yourself, I recommend you donload the libary files directly and 
place them in sites/all/libraries/pear

Requires
http://pear.php.net/package/PEAR
http://pear.php.net/package/Console_Getopt
http://pear.php.net/package/Image_GraphViz/

You should end up with (at least) the required files 
sites/all/libraries/pear/System.php
sites/all/libraries/pear/Console/Getopt.php
sites/all/libraries/pear/Image/Graphviz.php

If you want other rendering engines apart from 'dot' and 'neato', they are not 
supported natively by the Image_GraphViz library, but can be enabled easily 
by applying the patch 
Image_GraphViz-1.3.0-support_other_rendering_engines.patch

== Binary image generators (Graphviz package) ==

This can be enabled on the server using your package manager, or directly
from http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php

After installation, you should end up with the tools 'dot', 'neato' and a few 
others in your PATH. Call with -V to ensure it works.
  dot -V
  dot - graphviz version 2.28.0 (20111028.1807)

This mush also work *for your webserver user* so take whatever steps are 
neccessary to ensure it's in your path.

== Usage ==

For usage and theory, see the contents of the 'help' folder.
