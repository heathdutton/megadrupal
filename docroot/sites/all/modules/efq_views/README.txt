This module enables Views to use EntityFieldQuery as the query backend,
allowing you to query fields stored in non-sql storage (such as mongodb).

Requires the Entity API (http://drupal.org/project/entity).

Limitations
-----------
1. Entity: Bundle (field/filter/sort) is not supported for
"EntityFieldQuery: Comment" and "EntityFieldQuery: Taxonomy term".
For taxonomy terms, the "vid" property can be used instead.
This is a Drupal 7 limitation: http://drupal.org/node/938462.

2. This backend doesn't support relationships.
EntityFieldQuery can't and won't support joins, which means
that this functionality would have to be emulated in the query class
(entity_load() on all related ids.)

3. An entity label, or a property, might not be a field in the database, it can
be generated by a callback function instead. In that case, we can only display
it, everything else (click sorting/filters/arguments/sorts) is disabled.

4. This backend does not support the "Or" filter operator due to limitations
in the EntityFieldQuery API. If you are using SQL based storage, you may be
able to use the HOOK_query_TAG_alter() method to implement "Or" filtering.
