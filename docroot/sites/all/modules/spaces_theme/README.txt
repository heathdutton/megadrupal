***** USAGE *****
This allows you to set the settings surrounding a theme on a per space basis.  The path /theme is added so that any space / group can alter things beyond just the theme in place such as primary links and logo.  The further customization can start to give people the impression that they have their own unique site while still all running off the same install.
