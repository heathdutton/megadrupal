Availability Calendar
=====================

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.x
=============================

Incompatibilities with 7.x-4.2:
-------------------------------
These are actions and checks you have to perform manually after you have
upgraded to this version.
- Clear all caches.
- Update ALL your views related to availability. All functionality is still
  there, but may have been moved or renamed. So you may get "broken handler"
  messages or handlers that do different things than before. E.g. "filtering on
  availability" will now be "filtering on calendar ID".

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.x-dev
---------------------------------

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.4
-----------------------------
- [#2426413]: Advagg module compatibility: hook-js_alter is superfluous.
- [#2390531]: Missed a possible problem with the bug fix.
- [#2390531]: Exposed availability filter does no longer set max or min value.
- [#2373631]: Configurable Start Date for rendering Availability Calendars.
- [#2366363]: Undefined index: availability_calendar_views_from_to1_from.

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.3
-----------------------------
- [#2364287]: Viewport button text does not format plurals.

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.2
-----------------------------
- [#1782086]: Customise 'Arrival date' and 'Departure date'.
- [#2327699]: Duration not shown as whole number when DST switches in selected
  period.
- React to browser window resizing by recalculating the available space for
  calendar months.
- [#2315235]: Availability filter does not work nicely together with auto submit
  exposed forms.
- [#2311255]: Regression in solving #2130799
- [#2254995]: Cannot filter on a single availability date.
- [#2130799]: Use of Colorbox breaks Previous link for scrolling calender.
- [#2202639]: Preview node does not work.

Availability Calendar 7.x-5.1 2014-04-10
----------------------------------------
- Merged changelog of availability_calendar_booking_formlet into this changelog.
- [#1986354]: Call to undefined function search_api_index_load_multiple().

Entity API integration

Should solve issues like:
[#1355834]: Using a contextual filter to get the state of the current day.
[#1270718]: Integrate with search api.
[#1856890]: Synchronisation with another website using ICS or XML.
[#1721844]: Rule event for after booking.
[#1783154]: Show all resources on one calendar.

Changes so far (compared to 7.x-4.2):
- Implement Entity API hooks.
  - Define availability_calendar_calendar as entity and define its properties.
  - Describe the availability_calendar field to Entity API.
- Further integration with Views (works only when Entity module is enabled):
  - Describe availability_calendar_availability and availability_calendar_state
    to Views.
  - Define sql date handlers for availability_calendar_availability.date field.
- Integrated with Search API:
  - Added a setting "Number of months to index" to the admin settings form at
    admin/config/content/availability-calendar.
  - Added a read only property "filtered availability" to our calendar entities.
  - Defined an "Availability" search api data type.
  - The above 3 changes allow to index availability.
  - Added an data alteration that allow filter on the type of field that refers
    to a calendar (when indexing availability calendar entities).
- Integration with search_api_views/search_api_db:
  - Added a filter and argument handler to filter on indexed availability. The
    handler alters the database query that gets built by Search API based on the
    Search API query. Therefore, only search_api_db is supported.

Changes to be expected to complete the calendar as entity feature:
- See the todo list in availability_calendar.entity.inc or file your own
  requests in the issue queue.

Other changes (compared to 7.x-4.2):
- Removed @class in php files, it is a js doc tag.


Availability Calendar 7.x-4.x
=============================

Incompatibilities with 7.x-3.x:
-------------------------------
These are actions and checks you have to perform manually after you have
upgraded from 7.x-3.x to this version. These actions are not necessary when you
already were on the 7.x-4.x branch.
- Depending on how you updated, you may have to manually delete the following
  files (containing Views handlers that are moved to the views sub-directory):
   * availability_calendar.views.inc
   * availability_calendar_handler_*.inc
   * availability_calendar_plugin_*.inc
- Visit and save the "field settings" for all calendar fields in your site, as
  the setting "Allow to disable the calendar for a calendar instance" (that
  appears on the edit form) is now a field instance setting instead of a widget
  setting.
- Clear all caches.
- Date formats are now customisable: customise (admin/config/regional/date-time
  and admin/config/regional/date-time/locale) them to your likings and check all
  your date handling and displaying parts to see whether they are still working
  as expected.
- Visit and save the "field settings" and "manage display" pages for all
  calendar fields and define whether they are day or overnight based.
- Visit and save the "field settings" and "manage display" pages for all booking
  formlet fields and check whether the new settings are better suited to your
  use case.
- Theming: check if all your custom styling still applies correctly. E.g., the
  buttons for the booking formlet are changed into <button>s; classes and other
  attributes have changed for several elements.
- Periods: the 2nd date of a period is either inclusive (day rental) or not
  inclusive (overnight rental, typically the "departure" date). In 7.x-3.x, the
  2nd date was always not inclusive. Test and check that every part is still
  working as expected.
- Booking formlet to webform POST: the arrival and departure fields are renamed
  to from_display and to_display. You have to update the default values for the
  elements that receive these values in the (or all in a multilingual site)
  webform. I.e: change "%post[arrival]" to "%post[from_display]" and change
  "%post[departure]" to "%post[to_display]".
- Booking formlet to webform POST: there are additional fields that now get
  posted: %post[from_iso] and %post[to_iso]. See the readme (of booking formlet)
  for an explanation of these values and their differences with from_display and
  to_display.
- API and JavaScript changes. Almost all API and JavaScript functions have been
  changed. Sometimes just slightly, sometimes they are completely rewritten or
  even replaced. If you have done custom coding: test it all. API changes are
  not separately described, they are part of the items in the change log below
  that is grouped by issue (feature/bug) not by API function.
