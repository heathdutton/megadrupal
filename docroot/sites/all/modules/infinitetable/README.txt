*reference from tbodyscroll js plugin:
Required user CSS:

1. User must define same width for <th> and <td> in each column, because 
<thead> and <tfoot> will be "disconnected" from <tbody> and won't keep same 
width automatically anymore.
2.  Some changes in user CSS may be needed because <table> will be wrapped by
 <div style="float:left">.
