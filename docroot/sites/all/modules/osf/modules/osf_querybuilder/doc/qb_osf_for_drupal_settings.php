  The <strong>OSF for Drupal Search Settings</strong> panel provides the ability
  to copy key changes in these various search configuration settings. Once
  copied, the Drupal site in which these changes have been made will now
  operate using these new settings. Specific settings that may be copied
  and pasted are:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="<?php echo $_GET['path']; ?>/doc/images/qb_search_settings.png" width="800" />
</p>
<p>
  Values within this panel may be copied and then pasted into Drupal to
  change the site's search behavior. Here is the screen for doing so within
  Drupal:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="<?php echo $_GET['path']; ?>/doc/images/qb_search_settings_drupal.png" width="800" />
</p>

  Settings.
