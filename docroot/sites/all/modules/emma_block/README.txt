-------------------------
Emma Block is a module for Drupal 6.x and 7.x that provides integration with myemma.com
mailing lists via version 2 of the Emma API. It creates a block that can be
assigned to any region which will take newsletter sign-ups from users without
the need for them to create accounts. Here is some of the functionality:

  * Ability to specify multiple mailing lists and have the user select which 
    they wish to register for or allow them to register for all at once.
  * Confirms email subscriptions via Emma to make it compliant with 
    double opt-in requirements.

There are no dependencies for this module. This module does require that 
cURL be installed and added to PHP.
