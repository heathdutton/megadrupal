Installation
============

1. Download and install the module as a usual Drupal module.
2. Attach the field to any of your fieldable entity.


Example
=======

Following the installation the module automatically create an example service endpoint.
After you've done the installation process and attached the field for example on the
article content type, your articles have an shared part.
If you create an article and complete the field resource machine name for example
"testid", you will get the field resource content in the following way:
http://yourdrupal/endpoint/resource/retrieve?id=testid
