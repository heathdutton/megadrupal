Issue #1452462 has already been comitted to the development branch but is not yet
in a released version. This patch uses native PHP (C) functions for hanlding
compression and fails more cleanly if the PHP compression filters are not
installed and available.

Once the next version of Backup and Migrate is released containing this patch
we will no longer need to ship with it. It you are using a development snapshot
from after March 5th 2012 this functionality is already included.
