This is a small helper module for those who:

Have a multilingual site.
Have features installed
See their feature overriden all the time, because the language
 in the export was different.
This is a tiny helper module that just does what is says:
-  it will redirect you to the english version of the features page
-  when you are visiting it in another language.
