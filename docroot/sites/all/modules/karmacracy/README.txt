-- SUMMARY --

Karmacracy is a democratic system that measures the audience of people by
counting clicks from the links they share on social networks. When a link is
shared, it is replaced by a link to a shortener. All the traffic generated
through this shortener is bound to the person that created the link; thus,
counting kclicks (clicks that carry karma).
