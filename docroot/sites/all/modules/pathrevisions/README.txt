Store URL paths with node revisions.

This module keeps track of the URL path for each revision of a node
in a database table.

Possible uses include URL rewriting in a front-end cache or tracking
when a URL on system system changed.

There is no frond-end interface, but there is an API.

When this module is enabled, the path revision history is available
in the node object.
