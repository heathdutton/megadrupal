Smart-Dash mode is an Emacs minor mode which redefines the dash key to insert an underscore within C-style identifiers and a dash otherwise.

It is the product of a mind that writes C every day and wishes it was writing lisp instead. My goal was to let you to type the underscore_separated_identifiers that are common in C or Python or PHP as comfortably as you would type lisp-style-identifiers.

Smart-dash mode authorship is Dennis Patrick Lambe Jr.
