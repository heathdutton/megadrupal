Drupal mode
===========

Unpack project archive then copy `./emacs/drupal` folder to you Emacs configuration directory (`~/.emacs.d` on Unix systems). Then copy text below to the end of Emacs init file::

  ;; Start Drupal IDE with `drupal-ide' command:
  (setq drupal-ide-load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "drupal/drupal-init.el"))
  (autoload 'drupal-ide drupal-ide-load-path "Start IDE for PHP & Drupal development" t)

This config will automatically load IDE functions and drupal-mode when you start IDE with `M-x drupal-ide` command. If you use Emacs mostly for Drupal works to you may explicitly load Drupal IDE on Emacs start with such init string::

  ;; Drupal IDE
  (load (concat user-emacs-directory "drupal/drupal-init.el"))

Optional settings
-----------------

Invoke settings with `M-x customize-group` for group `drupal`.


Requirements and compatibility
==============================

Tested with GNU/Emacs 23 on GNU/Linux. Initscripts not compatible with Emacs 22. Not tested with Emacs 24.
Most likely Drupal IDE will works on other unices. Windows don't supported.

Drupal IDE automatically install own php-mode (version from https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode) and tries to use it instead system Emacs php-mode.


Syntax checking with Codesniffer (flymake)
------------------------------------------

Emacs 23 shipped with flymake library but the IDE coming with improved version from https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake.
Anyway you don't need to install `flymake` separately.

You need PHP working from command line (php-cli). Also PHP must be configured with E_PARSE included into `error_reporting`
configuration variable (E_ALL includes it).

XXX
By default flymake will use only basic syntax checks with `php -l`. You may use extended rules from PHP Codesniffer library then read
instructions for Drupal module `drupalcs` http://drupal.org/project/drupalcs

XXX In current version of IDE always used Codesniffer library. Fallback to `php -l` not used.


Code snippets with Yasnippet
============================

You need to install Yasnippet for using code snippets. Install it with appropriate way (from your distro package or with elpa/el-get)
