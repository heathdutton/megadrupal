Adds swipe gesture support for Lightbox2. This makes a lot of sense on mobile or responsive pages, because the "Next" an "Prev" Buttons are only visible on hover.
Description

Adds swipe gesture support to the well known Lightbox2 module for mobiles. Just swipe left or right on galeries to show the previous or next element!
Dependencies:

    Libraries API Module (>= Version 7.x-2.x)
    Lightbox2
    jQuery 1.7+ (provided by jQuery Update) Please do not forget to check & select the version in the jQuery Update Module after install!

Installation:

    Download and enable this module.
    Download jquery.event.move and jquery.event.swipe from the project page (http://stephband.info/jquery.event.swipe/) and extract them as separate folders to sites/{all}/libraries/ (folder names: "jquery.event.swipe" and "jquery.event.move". (>= 7.x-2.x)
    Enable jQuery 1.7 (or higher) in jQuery Update settings ("admin/config/development/jquery_update"). Notice: In our tests 1.7 worked with fewest problems. 1.8 and others are also possible. BUT: Please check if there are bad side effects in your environment!

Demo:

The lightbox galleries on our website http://www.webks.de use the swipe gesture support. Please try if they work on your device / browser correctly before posting a device error. If they work and on your Drupal website don't work, you've made a mistake perhaps.
