CONFIGURATION

a file view is enabled. This module provides two entity view modes for files. 
One is used to render the file in poll choice form (Poll Choice Form) and the
other when the results are viewed (Poll Results). To configure those view modes
go to: 

 *Administration » Structure » File types » (The desired file type)
  » Manage file display
 and choose your settings for each view mode.
