THIS FILE CONTAINS SPECIFIC NOTES PERTAINING TO THE INSTALLATION AND 
USE OF THE 'namecards' MODULE

INSTALLATION NOTES:

- trouble shooting dependencies. 
As of writing the latest stable version of views-7.x-3.0-rc3 is not 
compatible with references-7.x-2.0-beta3.  This may result in errors 
when trying to view contacts by org or event.  To solve this problem 
be sure to upgrade to references-7.x-2.x-dev. Hopefully this will be 
fixed in future stable releases of the "references" module.
