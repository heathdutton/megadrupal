The Flashcard Cycle module requires the jQuery Cycle Plugin. It can be
downloaded from http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/download.html, and should be
placed in the sites/all/libraries and unzipped, so that you have
sites/all/libraries/jquery.cycle/jquery.cycle.min.js.

To ensure proper integration and to prevent conflicts, Flashcard Cycle also
requires the Libraries API module: http://drupal.org/project/libraries.
