Pathauto Enforce
================
This module provides two different functionalities:

1) Ensure that for the selected content types and vocabularies, path aliases are always generated using the Pathauto
patterns, and never arbitrarily by a user. For these bundles, the Pathauto option "Generate automatic URL alias" will
always be checked.
2) Ensure that for the selected content types and vocabularies, path aliases are never created using the node edit form
(neither by Pathauto or by a user).

See https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto_enforce for more information.
