There is a vast array of theming possibility with Amazon and the Amazon Media
module.

Most of the theming is done with .tpl.php files. You can copy these .tpl.php
files into your theme and modify them:

amazon-inline-item.tpl.php              a simple text link
amazon-item-details.tpl.php             an item with detail info
amazon-item-detail.tpl.php              a single detail (for amazon_filter)
amazon-item-thumbnail.tpl.php           a thumbnail image
amazon-item--large.tpl.php              a large image
amazon-item--medium.tpl.php             a medium image
amazon-item.tpl.php                     an item with less detail
amazon-views-view-row-item.tpl.php      a views row

In addition, "theme hook suggestions" are provided for both amazon-item and
amazon-inline-item. For an amazon-item, you can theme it with a template
flle named amazon-item--<type>--<style>, so you could separately theme
large DVD images with a template file amazon-item--dvd--large.tpl.php in your
theme.

The amazon_media module, if enabled, extends theming capabilities with a number
of its own template files and a few template functions. You can override those
as well.

In most cases an overwhelming number of variables is available in the template
file. See template_preprocess_amazon_item() in amazon.module for more
information.
