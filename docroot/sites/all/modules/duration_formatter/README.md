This simple module provides a field formatter for number fields (integer,
decimals and floats) which converts seconds into a human-readable format.
This is useful when extracting the duration of a song into Drupal and it should
be displayed as readable time format.

# Installation

1. Install the module the [drupal way](http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7)

2. Select "Duration" as field formatter for a number field
