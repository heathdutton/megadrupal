uc_hotel 6.x-2.x, 2010-07-03
------------------------------------------
by larowlan: 
Complete rewrite
#hotel_room_type and hotel_calendars rolled into hotel_booking (you can’t have one without the others).
#All forms go via Forms API (no more x_x_x_x args etc) – hence other modules can modify the form and also the search results using hook_form_alter etc and the admin forms now receive complete token protection.
#Available rooms in the search results fetched via one query.
#Significant tuning of search results logic, e.g. prices are fetched in one query, not one query for every node for every date, with abstraction to utility functions for other modules to reuse.
#Occupancy modifiers are now applied via a hook system, other modules can define their own modifiers (keep an eye out for monthly, weekly pricing and long-term stay discounts – to be released soon).
#More use of core apis like drupal_write_record and menu object loaders.
#Complete rewrite of database structure to use more consistent naming conventions.
#All markup comes from theme functions and templates. Templates for calendars, search results, availability keys, tooltips, prices in calendars etc etc. 
#Removed external tooltip library to utilise Drupal module beauty tips instead (optional – not required if not using tips). 
#Book now form in node pages.
#Template for nodes: calendars, booking form etc available as variables in templates via config options.
#Weight of calendar, book now fields can be reordered from cck field admin screens (if not using template variables)
#Some views integration for room nodes
