The goal of the modules in this package
is: To provide you with the necesary tools to run a
reservations website and have the possibility to manage
your resources online. 

1.: make sure the maximum php executiontime
is set to 400 ---> ini_set('max_execution_time', 400); to your settings.php file

install the required modules:
references, user_reference, node_reference, date, date_views, views, ctools, 
i18n, date_api, date, date_views date_popup, uc_cart, uc_product,...

3.: install the agreservations modules in the following order (assuming you want online booking and payment functionality):
    1: agreservations,
    2: agres_bookings 
    3: agres_categories

    if you want timebased restrictions and seasonally different productprices:

    4: 	Agreservations Timeframe

7.: the module contains a default view bookingcalendar which should be
 installed automatically. When you followed the above steps you should

 You can click on the little '+' signs
 for each day/room and make a booking, you see the agreservation form prefilled
 with the correct day and room you clicked on. You can choose more rooms of course.

 in Administer->blocks. This is for the frontpage for users to make onlinereservations.
