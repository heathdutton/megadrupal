------------------------------
         DEBUGGING
------------------------------

In case you run into problems there are few things to check.

* Watchdog log messages
The module extensively checks for errors and logs them.
User behind browser will get only a general message.

* Turn on additional logging
In beginning of commerce_estcard.module:
define('ESTCARD_DEBUG', TRUE);
The module will log data sent_to/received_from Estcard.
Turn debug off at production.

* Check webserver error log


The settings (URL,ID,Keys,Cert) are not validated in any way.
Keys and Cert should be copy-pasted from respective file 1:1.
Including lines like: -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- etc.
