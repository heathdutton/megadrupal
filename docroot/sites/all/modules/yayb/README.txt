Yet Another Yellow Box 7.x-1.x
==============================

Allows for the creation of a block that allows trusted users to post alert
messages to a block. Block administrators may edit the content of the
message (filtered by the site's default input filter) and may toggle display
of the block on or off.

Install like any other Drupal module, then place the block in the desired
region. If desired, limit where block is displayed - usually the home page -
and grant appropriate permissions to the role who should administer the
message.
