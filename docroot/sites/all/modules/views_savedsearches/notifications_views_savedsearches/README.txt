Views Saved Searches Subscriptions
----------------------------------

This module offers notifications (notifications) integration
for saved searches.
So users are able to follow views by certan filters.

For nodes, the teaser will be in the notifications, for 
other type of objects, the first textual field is the title.

The whole process of checking out the Views by the search filters
happen in cron time, so set up cron as frequently as you would
like to be informed about the new items in your views.

Read about cron jobs here: http://drupal.org/cron

THIS MODULE IS NOT FUNCTIONAL UNLESS CRON WORKS NORMALLY
