TABLE TIDY
==========
Table Tidy declutters HTML tables, removing duplication and giving them a tidier
appearance that is both compact and easier to read.

On specified pages, each table cell holding content identical to the cell above
it is blanked out or replaced by one of the following:
o an unobtrusive symbol like a double quote ", an ellipsis ... or a ▲
o a short text, like "as above"
o a font icon character, like the icons from Font-Awesome,
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet, or a similar library.

The replacement text or symbol and the pages on which it should be activate on,
can be specified by the site builder, see below.


Installation and configuration
------------------------------
Install like any other module. There are no dependencies or permissions to set.
The module works out of the box on a number of pages.
Visit, say, admin/content or admin/reports/dblog to see the module in action.
Alter the pages that you wish the module to be active on, on the module
configuration page, admin/config/content/table-tidy.


Notes
-----
Table Tidy operates on:
o tables generated via core's theme_table() function;
o tables generated by Views, via Views' native Table format or similar plugins,
  as provided by contributed modules, if enabled.

Empty cells or cells holding a single character won't have their content
replaced.


Using special symbols and font icons
------------------------------------
On the module configuration page, admin/config/content/table-tidy, you can style
the "Same as above" text using any sequence of CSS class names.
The HTML style="..." attribute is not allowed.

Example:
  <span class="tt-grey tt-right"> - - </span>

Instead of <span> you may use <i>.

See the table_tidy/table_tidy.css file for some canned styles you may want to
use. You can of course add your own, or use styles already provided by your
site's theme.
In the "Same as above" box on the admin/config/content/table-tidy configuration
page, you can paste symbols like ✶ and ▲ directly from http://text-symbols.com.

To use Font Awesome icons visit http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome and
press the "Download" button. Unzip the downloaded file into your Drupal
libraries directory, typically sites/all/libraries. If you wish, remove the
version number from the directory name, so that the path to the essential style
sheet becomes

  sites/all/libraries/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css.

Now enter the above path at the bottom of the configuration page and use your
icons like so:

  <i class="tt-center fa fa-angle-double-up"></i>
or
  <i class="tt-center tt-grey fa fa-chevron-up"></i>
or
  <i class="tt-grey fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i>
or
  <i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>
or
  <i class="fa fa-bolt"></i>
etc.

NOTE: if you are using a Bootstrap-based theme, then it may already have loaded
the Font-Awesome font library for you, so you won't have to download it and
can start using the above <i> snippets straight away.

You can assemble your own icon set at fontello.com and download it to
sites/all/libraries. Then again enter the path to the main .css file at
admin/config/content/table-tidy.


Caveats
-------
Table tidying does not go well in combination with client-side sorting also
being added to tables, e.g., on pages where module
http://drupal.org/project/table_trash is active also and sorting is used.
