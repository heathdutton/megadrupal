This it the abbreviated documentation for http://www.drupal.org/project/update_rules.

FULL DOCUMENTATION: http://www.drupal.org/node/2470039.

This module provides rules events, actions, and conditions related to Drupal project update statuses.
Drupal core offers a simple email notification when the site needs core/module updates. Unfortunately
those emails do not contain any information about the projects or the releases, and you're at the mercy
of the standard update notification configuration. This module solves this problem, and gives you all of
the capabilities (actions, conditions, etc.) of Rules for handling update statuses. Imagine being able to
send an email to your task management app with the server name, project name, and release info every
time a security update is needed. This is a simple example, but was the exact goal I was shooting for
when I wrote this module.
