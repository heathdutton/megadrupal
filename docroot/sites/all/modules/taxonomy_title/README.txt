Overview:
--------
By Default, the title of a taxonomy page is only the term itself. Though 
that's usually enough information to get the point across, it's not very 
user friendly. For SEO reasons most people would probably prefer more 
keyword-rich words in the heading than just the term name.

This module adds an additional "Term heading" field allowing admins to 
configure a specific Title for each Taxonomy term page.

* Tokens are also provided for use with the Page Title module.

* Taxonomy title now supports the i18n strings module for translation.
