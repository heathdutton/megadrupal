Below is a list of changes that were made in version 5 of webform2sugar

-- Mappings are now stored in the database.  This allows for a single webform field to be mapped to multple fields in sugar and for a single sugar field to have multiple fields mapped to it.
-- Settings are now managed on seperate page inside of the webform tab.
-- Each webform can now be sent to a different sugarcrm server
-- Campaign Ids can now be overriden on the form so that a single form can go to multiple campaigns.
-- Webform2Sugar now checks urls to be sure they are accessible before saving them to the database.
-- Webform2Sugar now supports custom mappings without hacking the webform2sugar_fields.inc file.
-- Webform2Sugar now uses the webform hooks to integrate with webform. Which means the following changes:
    - Multi-Page forms now work in all cases.
    - Webform2Sugar now sends the value of selectboxes and checkboxes, not the safe key.
    - webform2sugar no longer "hijacks" the key values in the webform fields, so these can now be used for other purposes.
