You can easily embed the results of a view into other parts of your site;
either with code as a module, or in nodes or blocks as snippets. The
easiest way is to use the function <strong>views_embed_view()</strong>:

<pre>/**
 * Embed a view using a PHP snippet.
 *
 * This function is meant to be called from PHP snippets, should one wish to
 * embed a view in a node or something. It's meant to provide the simplest
 * solution and doesn't really offer a lot of options, but breaking the function
 * apart is pretty easy, and this provides a worthwhile guide to doing so.
 *
 * @param $name
 *   The name of the view to embed.
 * @param $display_id
 *   The display id to embed. This will be 'embed_ID'.
 * @param ...
 *   Any additional parameters will be passed as arguments.
 */
function views_embed_view($name, $display_id = 'default') {
</pre>

To figure out the id of a display, hover your mouse over the tab to select that display. Everything after the '#views-tab-' is the id of that display. This ID is guaranteed never to change unless you delete the display and create a new one.

I will be expanding this in the future on other ways to embed views and retrieving specific data etc...
