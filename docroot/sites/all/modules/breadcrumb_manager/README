-- SUMMARY --
This module resolves an endemic problem of Drupal, the breadcrumb management,
in the simplest way you can imagine: without doing nothing!
Breadcrumb manager automatically recognizes the correct breadcrumb you want
based on the URLs of the pages and the items included in the menu.
Breadcrumb altering is allowed via new hook_breadcrumb_alter.

Optionally it also ensures the persistence of active trail and
the "override" of the page title.

From the configuration panel you can manage the optional features and
enter the path to be excluded by the behavior.
