What do I get in this module?
********************************************************************************
Nothing really usable in here. This module is a parent module for a the OpenEDU
suite of modules. Please see the main project page for more information on this.

So why does this module exist?
********************************************************************************
As time goes along and more modules are released some 'glue' will be needed to
support them. This module will be a good place for that code.
