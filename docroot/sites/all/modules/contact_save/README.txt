-- SUMMARY --

Never miss a contact message again! This module stores in the database
all messages submitted through the core contact forms.

This solves the problem of e-mails which don't make it to their proper
destination (due to a wrong email address, network failure,
mail server problem, or spam blocker), which can cause misunderstandings,
lost job opportunities, etc.

Additionally, this module provides a way to respond to these messages
through the website, which can serve as a basic correspondence tracker,
so that no messages go unanswered.

-- INSTALLATION --

* Put the module in your drupal modules directory and enable it in
  admin/modules.
