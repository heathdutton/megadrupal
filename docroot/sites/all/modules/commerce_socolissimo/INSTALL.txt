INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download and enable the module. see http://drupal.org/node/895232

2. Configure your So Colissimo shipping services.

   You can access services configuration here :
     admin/commerce/config/shipping/services/socolissimo-flexibility

   What you are probably looking for here is the "manage rates" button, it lead
   you to a page where you can define a rate grid for each of the services.
   You can define different shipping prices base on order's weight, and even
   have different prices according to the delivery country.
   To have a quick demo of what you can do just import our demo file using the
   "Import" tab and the demo/SoColissimo_rates.csv file.

   At any given moment you can decide to disable a particular service using the
   "disable" link, this will just make the service unavailable to customers.
   It won't destroy any of your data, I mean rates amounts.

3. Configure So Colissimo API credentials.

   In order to provide a map where the customer can choose a delivery point,
   this module need to deal with 2 API :

   * So Colissimo Flexibility API
   * Google Maps API (v3)

   So Colissimo Flexiblity API credentials are mandatory to use those sevices :

   * Cityssimo (FR only)
   * Local store
   * Post office

   Configuration available here :
   * admin/commerce/config/socolissimo-flexibility

4. Configure your products.

   So Colissimo Flexiblity services will only be available for orders which have
   a defined weight, since we rely on customer order weight to define a
   shipping price.

   The order weight is defined by products weight, so let's add a weight field 
   on your products.

   * Add a new field of type "Physical weigh" on product type
   * Add a new product, fill in the weight field

5. Enjoy !

   Now you should be able to ship your products using So Colissimo services.
