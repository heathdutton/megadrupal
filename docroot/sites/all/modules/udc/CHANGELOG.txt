------------------------------------------------------

2012-03-27 Added possibility to define USER_DATA_CONNECTOR_MODULE_PATH in
           the client script to specify the URI path to the module. The 
           constant is used to access the server script if the normal
           path determination fails. The auto path determination now throws
           an exception on failure, so that the error source can be traced
           more efficiently.

2012-04-08 Fixed bug for servers behind routers, fixed potential include
           bootstrap issue, added HTTP user agent verification.

2012-07-28 Added sample code generator in admin.inc. Switched to preferred 
           cURL connections in DrupalUserBase.class.inc. Switched from static 
           bool DrupalUserBase::$serverUseSSL to constant USER_DATA_CONNECTOR_USE_SSL. 
           HTTPS-only setting is now default disabled.
