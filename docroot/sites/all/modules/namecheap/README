Place the appropriate version of the Namecheap SDK in the libraries directory
within the site you are working. That may be 'default' or 'all' like the
following: sites/all/libraries or sites/default/libraries. The end result after
extracting the library should be
sites/.../libraries/namecheap/registrars/namecheap/namecheap.php.

Configuration can be performed either using variables hardcoded into
settings.php or the UI. If you want to hardcode them then look at the UI for the
variable names.

  $conf['namecheap_username'] = '...';
  $conf['namecheap_password'] = '...'; // API key, but SDK did not rename it.
  $conf['namecheap_testmod'] = '...';

The following is an example of how to use the API inside of Drupal.

  libraries_load('namecheap');
  $params = namecheap_params();
  $params['sld'] = '...';
  $params['tld'] = '...';
  $result = namecheap_GetNameservers($params);
