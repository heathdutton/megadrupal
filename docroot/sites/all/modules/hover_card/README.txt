INTRODUCTION

link, or any html element of your choice. This module extends Drupal to provide
Hovercard for the users of the website.

   Please visit https://github.com/prashantchaudhary/hovercard/ for jQuery

INSTALLATION
------------

 * The hover_card.module is very similar to other Drupal modules which requires
   Libraries Module to use 3rd party code integration. Hence, for installation
   of the Hover Card module please follow the below mentioned steps:

 * Install as usual, see https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further
   information.

 * Download and install the Libraries Module - 2.x from
   https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries and after the module installation
   create a new folder called 'libraries' under your sites/all/ folder.
   (Creating this folder will help us to locate our 3rd party code integration.)

 * Download the compressed version of jQuery Hovercard Plugin from
   https://github.com/prashantchaudhary/hovercard/archive/master.zip
   and extract the files into sites/all/libraries/hover_card/

 * Now, in your sites/all/modules/contrib/ directory download the Hover Card
   module.

 * Enable the Hover Card module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * After enabling it please check your admin/reports/status where there should
   be a new option showing Hover Card Plugin - v1.0 installed with a success
   (green) status.

 * There is configuration link for this which you can access at
   admin/config/people/hover-card. When enabled and configured properly, this
   module will display the hover card to the user links with 'username' as class
   to their anchor tags. To disable the hover card from user links, disable the
   module and clear caches.
