This module helps you to make your website content consistent by forcing image
size as a function of its alignment. The image size is defined with imagecache
so that images can have only 4 different size based on the alignment (left,
right, center, none).

With this consistency, make a mobile version is straightaway: you just define
another presets. You don't have to care about custom size that content
contributors use.
