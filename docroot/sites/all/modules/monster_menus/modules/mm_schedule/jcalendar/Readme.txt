This module is a Drupal 7 port of the jcalendar module, which was part of the
Drupal 6 version of the calendar module.

The Drupal 7 version of the calendar module includes support for using the
colorbox library to provide a popup dialog containing the details of events.
However, we do not wish to use colorbox, so we decided to port jcalendar
and add a few frills instead.

Just some credits.

The throbber is from thickbox and the x is from a jquery tooltip library, although I cannot remember which.
