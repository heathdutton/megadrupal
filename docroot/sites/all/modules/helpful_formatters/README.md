Helpful Formatters
==================

A collection of helpful display formatters for taxonomy terms, images, and text fields.

Formatters currently include:
* **URL to image style**: Outputs only the url to an image style
* **Text with line-breaks**: Designate a character (such as "|") be replaced by a line-break. Helpful if you want your title to be displayed with a break in a specific spot.
* **Title, with unique class**: Automatically add titles to links based on the link label text and a specified prefix. For example, a link with the title "Home Page" would get the class, "link-home-page".
* **Taxonomy Term Link**: Specify the link url for a taxonomy term label. Helpful for advanced views integration. Rather than linking to `taxonomy/term/1`, your taxonomy label could link to `events?category[]=1`.
