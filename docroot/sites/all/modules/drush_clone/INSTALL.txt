Installation
------------
Drush clone depends on drush (the DRUpal SHell). To use drush_clone, you
first download and install drush from http://drupal.org/project/drush.

The simplest way to install drush_clone:

drush dl drush_clone

the command must be executed outside any Drupal project (i.e. in your user
home).

Alternatively you can put your Drush command file in a number of places:

a) In a .drush folder in your HOME folder. Note, that you have to create the
   .drush folder yourself.
b) In the system-wide Drush commands folder, e.g. /usr/share/drush/commands
c) In a folder specified with the --include option
   (see `drush topic docs-configuration`).

More detailed install instructions can be found at
http://drupalcode.org/project/drush.git/blob/HEAD:/README.txt.
It contains a section (COMMANDS) about installing other commands like
drush_clone.
