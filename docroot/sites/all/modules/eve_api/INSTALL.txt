------------

 1. Configure your cron to run through your servers crontab and to run every
    minute. For more information please open the below link.  It is recommended
    to install elysia_cron for cron management, it is not required, but it is
    highly recommended due to increased load of running cron every minute.

 4. Upload all the files/folders from the zip/tar.gz from step 2 and upload it
    to your Drupal installation under sites/all/modules/eve_api.

    If done correctly you should see the file eve_api.module and various
    other files/folders when you navigate to sites/all/modules/eve_api.

 5. Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to the Modules page
    at admin/modules. Enable Omni EVE API listed under Omni EVE API.

 6. Still logged in as an administrator, go to EVE API page at
    admin/eve_api/settings. Registrations will be disabled until a valid
    Corporation API Key is entered. Create or retrieve your Corporation API Key
    from http://goo.gl/LDks44 and enter the "Key ID" and "Verification Code" in
    the appropriate fields. Be sure to tick the check-box "Enable Omni EVE API"
    and click on "Update". It may take up to a minute for the cron task to run

    for any groups created.  This may be helpful if you have a large number of
