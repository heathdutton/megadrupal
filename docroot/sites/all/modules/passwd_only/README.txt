How the module works
--------------------
First you install the module, you have to select one user (or create an new
user) to use with PassWd only. The password you set for this user is the login
password in the PassWd only login form.

Caution
-------
A Visitor of who uses the PassWd only login form has the same rights and
privileges as user who logges in with the normal login forms. You should only
use this module if you know what you do. Never use the root uses (User id 1)
with this module.

Module integration
------------------
The module PassWd only integrates well with logintoboggan.
