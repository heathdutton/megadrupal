The Views node access module implements the additional access control to views:
* Node type
* Node type and role
* Node type and permission


This allows to embed views pages as tabs on specified node types. 
In addition the role and permission of users can be specified.

You can append a view page for a special node type and use 
paths like 'node/%/my_page_view' with selecting menu entry as tab. 
The view is then shown only on the specified node types in the tabs.
