========= About ================

This module provides a field where you can enter a URL of a YouTube video, 
Flickr slideshow or any other media source supported by Video Filter module.
Then the URL automatically displays as an embedded media object.

This provides a simple, light-weight options for adding media nodes,
and re-using that media with Views and views-based modules like Views Slideshow.

========= Installation =========

Enable the module on the modules page.

========= Instructions  ================

Go to Administration -> Structure -> [Selected content type] -> Manage Fields.
Create a new field. Under "Select a Field Type" choose Video Filter.
That's it.

Please see Video Filter module's documentation for instructions on how to add 
support for additional video services, http://drupal.org/project/video_filter.
