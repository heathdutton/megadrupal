Module: Zemanta

Description
===========
Blogging tool, that saves you time, 
brings more traffic and makes your posts beautiful.

Have your browser understand what you are blogging
about and suggest pictures, links, articles and tags 
to make your posts more vibrant. 
While you are writing your post, Zemanta analyzes the 
text and recommends additional 
content you can use to spice it up.

This module integrates Zemanta experience into Drupal workflow.
After install you will have to change 
the input format to allow some additional tags.

Because it it difficult to integrate with numerous themes for Drupal,
Zemanta browser extension is tested and works well with all themes which
come with default Drupal installation. If you use some other Drupal
theme and Zemanta browser extension does not work, you have two options how to use Zemanta:
1) In Drupal you can use different theme for Admin interface. Set your
Admin interface theme to one from the default pre-installed themes
(Administer -> Site configuration -> Administration theme)
2) Use Zemanta server side Drupal module (this module) with any Drupal theme.
