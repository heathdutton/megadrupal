Using Browsenodes with the Amazon Store module
----------------------------------------------

You can easily get a list of related items under a particular browsenode
in the Amazon hierarchy. You just need to find the browsenode you want.

To find a browsenode, use the information at http://browsenodes.com
You can also use the browsenodes panel optionally provided with
amazon_store to see browsenodes related to a particular product.

When you have a browsenode, you can use a URL like
http://example.com/amazon_store/?BrowseNode=319596011
to display all the items in that browsenode.

The browsenodes.com FAQ is useful: http://www.browsenodes.com/page-FAQ.html,
as is the article "Are Browsenodes disappearing" at
