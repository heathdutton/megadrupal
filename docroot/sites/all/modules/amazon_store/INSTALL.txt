Installation:

1. Install and enable the module as usual. Prerequisites include
   the Amazon module (http://drupal.org/project/amazon) and optionally
   the panels module (http://drupal.org/project/panels)
2. Configure the various items in admin->config->Amazon Settings->Amazon. 
3. Make sure you're running cron, or the store's inventory will get hopelessly out of
   date with the actual Amazon inventory.
4. Configure the various items in admin->settings->Amazon Settings->amazon store. 
5. Optionally enable and configure the Item Page panel. A default panel is provided.

1. Colorbox: If colorbox is installed (http://drupal.org/project/colorbox), the 
   product images will link to nice larger images on the page. You have to
   enable "colorbox inline" at admin/config/media/colorbox. (Colorbox in Drupal
   7 replaces the thickbox support in Drupal 6.)
2. Panels: If panels is installed, you can customize the way an individual 
   product is displayed.
