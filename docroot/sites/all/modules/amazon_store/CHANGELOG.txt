amazon_store 2.0alpha1 2009-07-19
--------------------------------
Features:
#502156: Support Panels/Ctools 3
#426912: Support alternate Amazon locales (Thanks, @the_g_bomb)

Bug Fixes:
#492460: Shopping cart image did not display in many situations.

Many small fixes to PHP style, and issues pointed out by logging errors
#522168 and #510980: Improve handling of random URL tossed at Amazon_store


amazon_store 1.0beta3 2009-05-29
--------------------------------

Bug fixes:

#474610: "Add to cart" should increment count if the cart already has item in it
#466616: Button images don't show if clean urls turned off
#461598: When SearchIndex equals All, BrowseNode cannot be present.

I also turned off the drupal_set_message() that by default was shown any time 
the Amazon API returned an error, regardless of whether it was significant to 
the user or not. These things still go into watchdog.

amazon_store 1.0beta2 2009-04-05
----------------------
- Added ability to configure default items in amazon_store by SearchIndex,
  BrowseNode, or by an ItemId list of ASINs
- Added admin capability to turn on or off the Search at the top of the amazon_store page,
  and also turn on or off the "Narrow By" and "Sort By" forms
- Added ItemId type as part of URL
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
- Added javascript behavior to show/hide full project description on the
  search results page
- Removed ugly extra entries under the amazon_store menu item
- Moved the search form into themable territory. You can theme the entire
  search results page (/amazon_store) by putting amazon_store_search_results.tpl.php
  into your theme's directory and then changing it. So you can change everything
  about that page.  Patches for improved display are welcome, as is CSS that you like.
- #424988 - Selected Product in my amazon store
- #427726 - Removal of search. Addition of view, or block
- #427156 - javascript:void(null) - Or, Show/hide full description not working.
- #424740 - Error with Amazon Module (same as http://xp-dev.com/bugs/3159/view/)
- Now validates as  XHTML 1.0 Strict
- #3568 (alonovo) - Search results pager was willing to go past the end of the results. This pager
  can certainly still use improvement
- #446300 - Error with links not done correctly in a site that's not in the root.
