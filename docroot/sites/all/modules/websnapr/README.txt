Install
-----
Install websnapr by downloading the module from Drupal.org.

Decompress the .tar.gz file and drop the entire compressed file contents into 
'sites/all/modules'. If this directory does not exist you may need to create it.

Enable the module at http://www.example.com/drupal/?q=admin/modules 
in the Javascript package.

Configuration
-----
Module should be ready for use for links in node pages as soon as it's enabled. 
However, for continuous usage, you'll need to signup at http://www.websnapr.com/ 
to get a "developer key". 

Feed this "developer key" in the module's settings form at 
http://www.example.com/drupal/?q=admin/config/user-interface/websnapr. 

There's also a CSS Selector option on the module's settings page for filtering 
hyperlinks to enable the WebSnapr Preview Bubbles for. 
Examples are provided for ease of understanding.

Bubbles are always enabled for hyperlinks having class "previewlink", 
irrespective of any configuration. Do not forget to configure permissions 
for user roles to view WebSnapr Preview Bubbles at 
http://www.example.com/drupal/?q=admin/people/permissions#module-websnapr.
