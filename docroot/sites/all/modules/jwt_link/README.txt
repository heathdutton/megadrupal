Installation
========================
Requires BSD-3-Clause licensed JWT class available at:
  https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt

Download and extract the PHP JWT package from https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt into this module's root.

The only required file is JWT/Authentication/JWT.php

This module expects the JWT.php file to be in <jwt_link module root>/JWT/Authentication/JWT.php

If this is not the case, update the 'require_once' line in jwt_link.module
