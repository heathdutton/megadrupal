-- SUMMARY --

This module allows you to specify different permissions for roles for all 
operations related to menu and menu items. You can delegate permissions 
for one role to edit the menu items of specific custom menu. Another role 
to have all permissions and so on ...

The module adds permission lines for every custom menu for all known 
operations - "add", "edit", "reset", "delete", "view". The module doesn't 
mess up the standard 'administer menu' permission. If a role has it then 
users with that role can do everything related to menus without the 
other permissions.

The module also has configurations if you want to add permissions even 
for menu settings, menu parents, add new menu or edit a specific menu.

The module is designed to help you grant access for specific role to 
play with one or more menus - add menu items, edit the menus, reorder 
them and etc...
