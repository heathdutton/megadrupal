Patch status.

This module adds information about patched modules to the available updates page at admin/reports/updates. This lets you
decide what to do with them when updating.

Patches are detected when they're placed in a module's directory, and end in the extension ".patch".

If you keep your patches somewhere else - let me know in the issue queue and I'll see about adding support for it.
