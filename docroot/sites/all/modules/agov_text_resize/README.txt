OVERVIEW
========

This is a simple module that provides buttons to increase or decrease font sizes. It does this by adding a .font-large class to the <body> element.

USAGE
=====

You simply need to add the aGov text resize block to a region in your theme (e.g. header) and then write CSS rules in your themes stylesheet to handle body.font-large.

This module doesn't include any styles, as this will vary from theme to theme.


Part of the aGov suite of modules. https://www.drupal.org/project/agov
