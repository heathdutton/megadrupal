Inline Manual is an online tool, making it easy for everyone to create, update
and re-use documentation as well as create product/site tours. Documentation
is interactive (step by step guides) that can be played and used by any 
web site or web application.

The Drupal module allows to fetch data from InlineManual.com and store them
locally. The data can be played using the player afterwards.

Obtaining the site API key
You have to have an account with InlineManual.com and created a site. Within
site > settings > player installation - you will find the site API key.
