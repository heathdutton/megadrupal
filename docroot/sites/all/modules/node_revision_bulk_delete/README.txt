This small module gives an extra feature to delete manually all revisions
of a specific node prior a selected one.

This module is not deleting revisions automatically, if you look for this
feature, check out the "Node Revision Delete" module
https://drupal.org/project/node_revision_delete

Configuration:
Has no configuration settings, just enable

Usage:
When you are deleting a revision of a node, a new checkbox will appear saying:
"Delete all X revisions as well prior this one.".
If you check it all the prior revisions will be deleted as well for the
given node.

Note: If you are deleting the oldest revision, the checkbox will not appear
as no prior revisions are available.

The module is created and maintained by Penceo / Gabor Peter.
