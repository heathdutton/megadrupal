REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------

These modules require:

- An existing sf-active site, including MySQL database and filesystem 
  (the uploads and images directories).

- Enough disk space to store an equivalent of two copies of the 
  existing sf-active site, including both its database and uploaded 
  files. The migration script copies each uploaded file rather than 
  using the same directory as source and destination.

- Drupal 7.x using MySQL as the database type. If using a pre-existing 
  Drupal site please be certain to make a backup before running the 
  migration!

INSTALLATION
------------

 1. Install Drupal 7.x with MySQL as the database type.

 2. Place the sfactive directory in your Drupal site's sites/all/modules 
    directory along with the other required contributed modules.

 3. Make the database for the sf-active site accessible via the same 
    MySQL username and password that the Drupal site uses. It is 
    recommended to use a different database for the sf-active and Drupal 
    sites because they both have a role table, and for easier cleanup of 
    the sf-active tables. If the sf-active site is not on the same 
    server, you will have to copy over and load the MySQL database.

 4. Likewise ensure the sf-active site's filesystem or a copy thereof is 
    available and readable. The sf-active uploads and images 
    directories are required to run the migration.

 5. Visit admin/modules and enable the "sf-active migrate" module, which 
    can be found in the DEVELOPMENT section, and, unless you want to use 
    Drush, also the Migrate UI module. These instructions assume you are 
    using Migrate UI.

 6. Visit admin/content/migrate/sfactive and configure the name of the
    sf-active database and the path to the sf-active document root.

 7. Visit admin/content/migrate, check all the boxes, select the Import
    operation, and click Execute.

 8. After migration is complete, read the messages which may include 
    informational notices, warnings or errors.

10. Make media && make trouble!
