INSTALLATION GUIDE:
===================

A. Installation
----------------
* Download & enable (& configure) the following dependant modules:
  - Entity API (http://drupal.org/project/entity)
    --> no configuration required
  - AES encryption (http://drupal.org/project/aes)
    --> after enabling, go to admin/settings/aes
    --> uncheck "Create AES passwords" if you don't want this feature or are unsure
    --> set "Key storage method" to file for maximum security
    --> set a "Path to keyfile" outside of your webroot with the necessary access restrictions
        (or end your file in .php extension so users can't access it)
        Enter a random string of characters in the keyfile (you can use https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm)
  - Libraries API (http://drupal.org/project/libraries)
    --> If you wish to connect to your CollectiveAccess installation through SOAP:
	    Download and install the nuSOAP library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/ to sites/<all or sitename>/libraries.
	    Make sure nosoap.php can be found at the location sites/<all or sitename>/libraries/nusoap/lib/nusoap.php
* Enable the CollectiveAccess module

B. Set up connection to CollectiveAccess
-----------------------------------------
1/ Go to Administration > Structure > CollectiveAccess instances
2/ Click "Add collectiveaccess instance"
3/ Add a description for this instance. A default machine name will be generated based upon this entry.
4/ Specify what kind of web service connection you would like to use.
   You should currently select "SOAP".
5/ Enter in the CollectiveAccess webservice URL.
   This is the full URL of your CollectiveAcccess installation, followed by /service.php
   So if your CollectiveAccess could be reached at http://collectiveaccess.myorganisation.org,
   your webservice URL would be http://collectiveaccess.myorganisation.org/service.php
6/ Enter the username and password of a CollectiveAccess user that has been given permissions to access the Web Services API.
   Please refer to the CollectiveAccess information for more details on how to set up users and roles.
   It is recommended to specifically set up a user account for contacting the web services.
   If you installed the AES module correctly, the password will be stored in encrypted form
7/ That's it. Drupal should now know about your CollectiveAccess instance. You should now go on and decide how you'd like to retrieve data from it.

C. Importing data from CollectiveAccess with the Feeds module
