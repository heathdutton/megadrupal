Description

This module converts any image in a map with interactive pins on it.
It creates a content type to add items to the map and a block to 
display on the site.

The edit/creation form has an interactive map to assign coordinates 
to the items.


Installation 
------------

 * Copy the module's directory to your modules directory and activate
 the module.
 * Place the block Simple Pin Map
 * Choose the image of the map and the marker on the module or the block
 configurations page.
 * You can also add custom marker images ( two images one for the active
state and another for the normal state ). To add a custom marker you can
upload the file that you need to call markerX.png and marker-activeX.png
where X is a number greater than 14 and lower than 30.
For example marker17.png and marker-active17.png would do it.
