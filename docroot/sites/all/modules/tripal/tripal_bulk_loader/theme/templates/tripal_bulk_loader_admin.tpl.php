<h3>Module Description:</h3>
<p>This module allows you to create loading templates for any tab-delimited
   data file which can be used repetitively for loading data into chado. The Loading Templates are a direct mapping
   between the columns in your file and the columns in chado tables. To use this tool
   you need to be very familar with the chado schema -See
   <?php  l(t('Chado -Getting Started'), 'http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started') ?>.
   The ability to add constants and specify values via foreign key contraints is also provided
   in order for the loader to fill chado columns which may be required but are not specified
   in your input file.
