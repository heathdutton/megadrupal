/**
 * This function is for features that align through an intermediate such
 * as 'EST_match' or 'match'.  This occurs in the case where two sequences
 * align but where one does not align perfectly.  Some ESTs may be in a contig
 * but not all of the EST.  Portions may overhang and not be included in the
 * consensus if quality is bad.
 * For example:
 *    Feature 1: Contig --------------------
 *    Feature 2: EST_match           -------
 *    Feature 3: EST                 ---------
 *
 * The feature provided to the function will always be the feature 1.  The
 * featureloc columns prefixed with 'right' (e.g. right_fmin) belong to the
 * alignment of feature 3 with feature 2
 *
 * Features may align to more than one feature and are not matches. We do
   * not want to include these, so we have to filter on the SO terms:
 * match, or %_match
