Views Isotope
-------------
Views Isotope implements the javascript isotope package by metafizzy.

## Dependencies
* ctools
* libraries

## Included modules
* 'views_isotope': Allows you to create isotope configurations and theme lists
using 'isotope_grid'. Don't be fooled by the prefix, this has nothing to do with
views, and can be used without the views module.
* 'views_isotope_views': Provides views plugins for isotope.
* 'views_isotope_example': A sample implementation of isotope that can be copied
for your own project.

## Installation
* Download the latest version of [jquery.isotope]
* Place isotope.pkgd.min.js in sites/all/libraries/isotope/

### Notes
* 7.x-2.0-alpha1 is a placeholder of a working version, prior to a major
rewrite. There is no upgrade path from that version to later versions.
* The D7 version of this module was based on a D6 version found in @funkym's
sandbox
* The D6 code was build using methods borrowed from views_cycle
