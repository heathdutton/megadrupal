This module allows users to be registered without the necessity to
inform an e-mail. Therefore, the e-mail field is non-mandatory.

This module must be used in very specific cases. Consequently, it might
possibly cause problems with some Drupal features, such as the user's
personal contact form and the e-mail checking of new user accounts (this
feature is disabled by this module, by the way).

This module is sponsored by Lexa Sistemas (http://lexasistemas.com.br).

1. INSTALLATION

1.1 Enable the module at /admin/build/modules
1.2 Go to /admin/user/settings, activate and configure the feature

2. OPTIONAL, BUT RECOMMENDED MODULES

We recommend the No Request New Password module be used. It disables
the "request new password" link in the user login block and page.
Download it at: http://drupal.org/project/noreqnewpass

3. TODO LIST

3.1 Improve English writing (sorry about that);
3.2 Port the module to Drupal 7;
3.3 Implement a way to separate users who have e-mail from the ones who
donâ€™t.
