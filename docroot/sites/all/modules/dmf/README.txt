Description
-----------
Some time by mistake we deploy a module on multiple locations/paths.
For example a module should be deployed one of the following location/path.
all/modules/
all/modules/contrib/
all/module/custom/

If module(s) are deployed more than one locations/paths. 
In that it is hard to find out the issue that why changes are not refelecting.

So this module is provide an path of the module from it is executing. 

Installation
------------
1. Copy the entire modules_path directory
   the Drupal sites/all/modules directory.

2. Login as an administrator. Enable the module in the "Administer" -> "Modules"
