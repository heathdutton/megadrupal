Introduction
============

The read only node module simply allows you 
to set a node as read only by adding a new "Publishing option" to it.
The module commes with 4 new permission :

set node as read only
set node stiky
set node status
set node promote

When a node is set as Read only, only the role with 
the permission 'set node as read only' can edit it.


Installation
============

* Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module


Configuration & Workflow
========================

* Check the new permission on admin -> people -> permissions
