As of version 1.7, this module supports the use of tokens in titles and content.
Some sites may run in to problems with recursion on the Token tree viewer (inline and
popup) which will cause a database timeout when trying to add or edit a snippet.

If you come across that, we recommend using the token_tweaks
(https://www.drupal.org/project/token_tweaks) module and setting
the UI limit to something that works for your site.
