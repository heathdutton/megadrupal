Drupal 7 problems:
------------------

 * Go through and deal with all the TODOs from coder_upgrade

 * Replace AHAH with Drupal 7 #ajax

 * Port to services 3.x

 * Check for hook_lingwo_entry_access() and replace with hook_node_access() -- bbcom_dictionary uses it!

 * Find usages of language_list() and covert to new return value:
   o Previously:
     $languages = language_list();
     $languages = $languages[1];
   o Now:
     $languages = language_list();

 * Convert our custom variable handling to the 'variable' module!

 * Rename all the lingwo_*.api.inc to lingwo_*.inc and use autoload to load them

 * #attributes => class takes an Array!

 * Explore using jQuery once to make Javascript events only get set once:
   o http://drupal.org/node/756722

 * Change #value -> #markup!

 * Convert Javascript boilerplate (behaviors, jQuery -> $, etc)

 * The .no-js class has become .js-hide

 * Convert drupal_add_js() to #attached

 * Update any static caches to use drupal_static().

 * Put config into seperate menu items instead of being MENU_LOCAL_TASK

 * Experiment with doing submit ajax, because it seems like all our ajax is expecting to work in this way,
   yet we only get a sub-set of the values when we have a button press...

 * .clear-block becomes .clearfix
