Installation
----------------
- Enable the module
- Create a taxonomy term in userpoints vocabulary (Say "Credit" for instance)
- Go to Store > Config > Commerce points settings
--> Setup the taxonomy term that will serve as "money"
--> Setup the price component that can be paid by the points
(base_price is the standard product total)
--> Setup the decimal multiplicator. Points are handled as "Integer" while
prices are most of the time "Decimals" (Even thought Drupal Commerce manages it
with Integer to avoid calculation precision issues). The easiest way to handle
it is to have a "100 points = 1 currency" value conversion rate. To keep this
conversion rate, leave the field value to 1.

- Grant points to your user
(either manually, through rules... whatever your workflow requires)


----------------
Test it !
