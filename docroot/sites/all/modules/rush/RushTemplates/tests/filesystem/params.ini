'

help = '
This job will do the following:

1. Create a build directory `test_filesystem` within your web root.
2. Put two folders in the build directory called: `patches` and `misc/logs`
3. Make two files within the build directory called: `README.md` and
`misc/README.md`
4. Create a .gitignore in the build directory with these two entries: `cache/`
and `files/`

Run the test a second to verify a backup of the build directory is created and
moved to your home directory before a new build directory is created.

In order to test the destroy build directory operation run this job with the
rush parameter set to `clean`.

    `drush rush Test.filesystem --rush=clean`
