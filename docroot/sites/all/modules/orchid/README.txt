Orchid is an module to integrate a Vanilla forum to your existing Drupal CMS.
Users can be auto-created at the first visit to the forum if you wish so.
This module also provide a block and a panel content to embed your forum in a drupal page.

You will need a vanilla forum instance, and the jsconnect plugin for vanilla installed and enabled.

I suggest that you create your "admin" user with the same username /email in both drupal and vanilla
(this is not a mandatory step but you will gain sso on the admin account).


Getting started: 

1. In the vanilla dashboard, enable the jsconnect plugin and go to the jsconnect 
configuration page in the vanilla dashboard.
Click on "generate client id and secret".

The authenticate URL needs to be the URL who will provide json informations.
It is provided by the drupal orchid module under the URI "orchid/jsconnect".
If your drupal website is available at http://www.mydrupal.com the authenticate url will be
http:// www.mydrupal.com/orchid/jsconnect.

If it's a localhost website and your drupal 7 installation resides at
http://localhost:9999/seven, it will be http://localhost:9999/seven/orchid/jsconnect.
also fill in Drupal's sign-in  and register URLs
sign-in url : http://www.mydrupal.com/user/login
register url : http://www.mydrupal.com/user/register 

2. In drupal go to Admin > Configuration > Vanilla forum settings
Copy / paste clientid and shared secret generated by vanilla.
Fill in your vanilla root URL.

3. Avatar settings (optional) 

First you need to enable user's picture in drupal users settings.
Choose to sync or not drupal avatar with vanilla (and if so choose a size).
