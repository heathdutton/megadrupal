Energy Dashboards w/ Drupal & BACnet
====================================

https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/dbt102/2237027

-- SUMMARY --

This BACnet module for Drupal turns web sites created by Drupal into "e-boards" 
(short for Energy Dash Boards).  
It is an energy management tool, 
allowing easy real-time monitoring of energy related data 
across a team within an intranet or other Drupal website.  

BACnet provides external library handling for Drupal modules.
