Simple module which allows look links to nodes, taxonomy terms, pages - with ".html" suffix.
 Without using custom path or pathauto path to your node will look like /node/1234.html.
 Path to taxonomy term - /tags/396.html instead of /taxonomy/term/12345

And thing, many people looking for: pages with page numbers - without ?page=123

They will look like /page/1234.html
 For example instead of /node?page=2 you will see /node/page/2.html

For future I think how to make suffix customizable and make wiki-like work of drupal for some node types.

All works with no need add paths to path table :)

Just turn on module to get it work
