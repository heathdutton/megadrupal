Commerce Bpost module
---------------------
Bpost Shipping Manager is a service offered by bpost, allowing your customer to
choose their preferred delivery method when ordering in your webshop.

The following delivery methods are currently supported:

* Delivery at home or at the office.
* Delivery in a pick-up point or postal office.
* Delivery in a parcel locker.

When activated and correctly installed, this module also allows you to
completely integrate the bpost administration into your webshop.
This means that orders are automatically added to the bpost portal. Furthermore,
if enabled, it is possible to generate your labels and tracking codes directly
from the Drupal order admin page.

No more hassle and 100% transparent!
