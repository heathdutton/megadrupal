INSTALLING MODULES AND LIBRARIES
--------------------------------
 * Download the module and all of its dependencies. Move them to the contributed
   modules location in your tree (e.g. sites/all/modules).
 
 * Downlaod Algolia search client PHP library from https://github.com/algolia
   /algoliasearch-client-php and move it into the external libraries location in
   your tree (e.g /sites/all/libraries). From that location, the 
   algoliasearch.php file should be accessible from algolia/algoliasearch.php  
   (e.g. /sites/all/libraries/algolia/algoliasearch.php).
 
 * Enable the module's dependencies on the modules admin page (/admin/modules).


CONFIGURING SEARCH API SERVER AND INDEX
---------------------------------------
 * On the Search API administration page (/admin/config/search/search_api), add
   a new server and check the "Enabled" checkbox. In the "ALGOLIA" section, fill
   in your Application ID and API key found in your Algolia dashboard on 
   https://www.algolia.com.
 
 * On the Search API administration page (/admin/config/search/search_api), add
   a new index, enable it and select the server you just created in the previous
   section. The index name provided will be used to create a new index on the
   Algolia platform. Please read the "Known problems" section of the README.txt
   file for the latest updates about the type of entity supported.
 
 * On the "Fields" tab of your index
   (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR INDEX NAME]/fields), check all
   the fields you want to have indexed in the Algolia index. At the very least,
   the entity ID field for the indexed entity type needs to be checked off (nid
   for nodes, uid for users, etc.). Please read the "Known problems" section of
   the README.txt file for the latest updates about the type of fields 
   supported.
 
 * On the "Filters" of your index (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR
   INDEX NAME]/workflow), select the filters you want to apply before the data 
   is being sent to Algolia's servers. A good starting combination could be 
   "Bundle filter" (allowing you to index entities of certain bundles only (or 
   content types in the node realm)), "Node access" and "Exclude unpublished 
   nodes". Please read the "Known problems" section of the README.txt file for 
   the latest updates about the type of filters supported.


INDEXING CONTENT
----------------
* On your newly created index page, (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR
  INDEX NAME]), click the "Index now" button. You should start seeing content
  populating the index in the Algolia dashboard on https://www.algolia.com.
