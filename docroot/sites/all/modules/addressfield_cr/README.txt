This module is a plugin for Addressfield module that provides a user friendly
Costa Rican address field.
======================================================

DESCRIPTION
------------
Costa Rica has a very unusual address format wich lead us to the necessity of
creating this module.
The module gives the user the possibility to enter his address by hierarchical
selection of Provinces, Cantons and Districts and then it returns the
corresponding Zip Code.

It also works the other way arround, if the user enters the Zip Code, the module
autocompletes the corresponding Province, Canton and District.


INSTALATION
------------
Download and install it, as any other Drupal Module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Add the Address Field to the entity you need to and then in the configuration
make sure to check "Costa Rican Address checkbox" option in order to activate the
Costa Rican Address Format.
