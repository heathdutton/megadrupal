Module: Commerce Pricing Attributes
Author: Netstudio.gr
Date: 11/1/2013

Description
===========

This module lets you set attributes on your products that affect the final price.

It tries to solve the problem that commerce has, where you need to create different products with different prices if you want to allow the user to select product options. That way may be viable if you have 1 or 2 options but it's not if you have more, where the product combinations maybe thousands or even millions.

So, let's say that you sell t-shirts. You may set a size attribute that changes the base price and another one based on color. You can have as many attributes as you want, thus solving the main disadvantage of commerce over ubercart.

This module is created and sponsored by netstudio.gr, a drupal development company in Athens, Greece.
