INTRODUCTION
------------

Current Maintainer: Bryan Sharpe <bryansharpe@gmail.com>

Ubercart Volume Pricing allows for multiple prices per volume of products
in Ubercart, this is sometime referred to as 'Bulk Pricing'. For example,
buying X amount of said product provides a different sale price then buying
a single unit. 


INSTALLATION
------------

Copy the folder into your modules directory (or within Ubercart directory 
to keep things in order).


MAINTENANCE
-------------

This project is not actively maintained, but I will try to help 
with any bugs/issues/etc.
