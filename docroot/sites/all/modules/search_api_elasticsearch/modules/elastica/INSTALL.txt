Please note: If you enable Search API Elasticsearch Elastica via Drush, Drush
will automatically attempt to install the library if it is not available.
This is the recommended way of installing the module.

Install Elastica library (with Libraries API)
------------------------

Elastica is an external php library used to communicate with elasticsearch
and required by the search_api_elasticsearch module.

To install it:

Download the archive at [1] and extract it in "sites/all/libraries" or
any other valid path reachable by the Drupal libraries module.

Or

Clone the repository in "sites/all/libraries" or
any other valid path reachable by the Drupal libraries module.

> git clone git://github.com/ruflin/Elastica.git

[1] https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/archive/v1.0.0.0.tar.gz

If manually installed, the library should reside at "sites/all/libraries/Elastica"
such that the path to the composer.json file is "sites/all/libraries/Elastica/composer.json"
(just used for reference even if you aren't using Composer Manager).

Alternatively, you can use drush to download Elastica in "sites/all/libraries"
or via Composer Manager (if Composer Manager is installed).

> drush download-elastica

Please, also note that if you use drush to install search_api_elasticsearch,
drush will attempt to download Elastica for you if not already present.

> drush pm-enable search_api_elasticsearch


If you uninstall search_api_elasticsearch, you will have to remove the
Elastica library manually.

Install Elastica library (with Composer Manager)
------------------------------------------------

Search API Elasticsearch supports Composer Manager. To use this module with
Composer Manager, you will first need to download and install Composer Manager.

After installing Composer Manager, you will need to rebuild your dependencies
at the following path:

  admin/config/system/composer-manager

If you already have Composer installed, you can then go to sites/default/files/composer
and run the following command:

  composer install

If you don't already have Composer installed, you will need to install it first.
The easiest way is to run the following:

  curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
  php composer.phar install

Alternatively, "drush download-elastica" will check for Composer Manager and
attempt to install the library via Composer Manager if available.
