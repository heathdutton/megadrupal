WHAT THE MODULE DOES
This module is useful if you have to check which users have read
your drupal documents. When these documents are displayed,
a checkbox appears and the current user should be able to sign
for acknowledgement by clicking on it.
You can also specify the date by which the document must be signed.
Clicking on 'Acknowledgements' tab, administrators can view a list
of all users with specification of whether or not they have signed
the document.
Latest features:
- administrators and authors can select the roles to which the
  document is intended;
- roles selection can be predefined in global configuration.
- roles selection can show only items selected in global configuration.
- an alternative form can be used for specific needs
- a filter for users table has been implemented;
- the ability for the end user to insert a note was added.
- user fields management improved.
- views integration added.
