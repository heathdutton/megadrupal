Sign for acknowledgement
------------------------
Date: 31/12/2015
Version: 2.13

WHAT THE MODULE DOES
This module is useful if you have to check which users have read
your drupal documents. When these documents are displayed,
a checkbox appears and the current user should be able to sign
for acknowledgement by clicking on it.
You can also specify the date by which the document must be signed.
Clicking on 'Acknowledgements' tab, administrators can view a list
of all users with specification of whether or not they have signed
the document.
Latest features:
- administrators and authors can select the roles to which the
  document is intended;
- roles selection can be predefined in global configuration.
- roles selection can show only items selected in global configuration.
- an alternative form can be used for specific needs
- a filter for users table has been implemented;
- the ability for the end user to insert a note was added.
- better users selection while editing a content
- now a notification email can be sent to selected users and roles
  while creating a new content.
- when a user or role is added to an old content, email is sent only
  to new users/roles
- views integration: user and date fields added.
- views integration: users other than current user are allowed. Filters improved.
