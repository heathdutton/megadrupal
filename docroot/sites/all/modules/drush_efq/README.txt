Drush EFQ

Drush EFQ makes it easy to run an EntityFieldQuery from drush and get the result. This can be used for informational purposes as well as piping into other scripts. This was originally written for ELMSLN so that we could easily pipe in how many courses were in a system or how many students in a course.
