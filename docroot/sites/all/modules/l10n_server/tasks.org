* Create hook_update_N() for updating permission tables

  http://drupal.org/node/224333#permission_tables

  New permission tables

  The {permission} table is gone, instead we have a {role_permission}
  which stores (role ID, permission string) pairs. Thus, each
  permission granted for a given role ID is a separate row in the
  table. This update is in system.install so that it will already be
  complete when any other core or contributed module update is
  running. This should make any alteration of existing permissions
  much easier.

* Check all TODO marks and fix them.
