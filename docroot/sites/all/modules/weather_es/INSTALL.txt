Installation
------------

 -Copy the "weather_es" directory into the modules directory.
 -Go to admin/config/services/weather_es and enable the weather_es module (it depends on the core block module)
 -Go on with the configuration, see below.

Configuration
-------------

 -If you want to have a system-wide weather_es block (i.e. the same
  location for every user), go to Configuration->Web Services->Weather_es
  and configure the location. Go to Structure->Blocks
  and enable the "Weather_es: system-wide" block.
 -If you want to allow users to configure their own custom weather_es
  blocks, go to People->Permissions and enable the
  "Administer custom weather_es block". You must set the Structure->Blocks
  settings like above to allow the user to see their weather_es block (they can
  change their settings in its user path => My weather_es).
 -If you want to add another location to your block, click on the
  "Create a new configuration or add a new location to an exisiting configuration." link.
  At the last step if you click on the "Save configuration" button YOU'LL OVERRIDE the previous configuration
	and if you click on the "Add new location" YOU'LL ADD a new location to your previous
	configuration.

Requirements
------------
This module works with Drupal 7.x.
