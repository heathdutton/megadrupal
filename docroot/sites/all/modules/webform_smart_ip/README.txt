INTRODUCTION
------------

The Webform Smart IP module creates a new Webform field type called 'smart_ip'
that uses the Smart IP module to provide additional data about the form
submitter in hidden fields. The data will show up on the Results/Submissions
admin pages, but will be hidden on the form submission.

* For a full description of the module, visit the project page, bug reports
  and feature suggestions, or to track changes:
    https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_smart_ip

This could be beneficial for lead generation sites that need to filter leads
by city or state.
