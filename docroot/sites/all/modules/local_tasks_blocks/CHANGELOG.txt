Local tasks blocks 7.x-2.x
==========================
- Improved upgrade script to attempt to translate 1.x block placement to new
2.x deltas.
- Added new "primary tasks only" and "secondary tasks only" options similar to
the 1.x version of the module.
- Created initial branch of 2.x version (radical departure from previous code).
Now the module offers only 2 blocks, a Plain block (normal rendering of
MENU_LOCAL_TASKS, just in a block) and a Menu block (tasks rendered like a
standard Drupal system menu tree via theme_menu_tree/theme_menu_links).

Local tasks blocks 6.x-1.2

Local tasks blocks 6.x-1.1
==========================

- #771042 by TessaBakker - Added a 'combo' block which combines both primary and secondary tasks into a single menu
- Improved support for the Garland theme, removing the redundant secondary tabs.
