INTRODUCTION
------------

Allow site administrators to make sure certain sections of their sites are
always accessed through SSL.

This module adds a reaction plugin to the Context module and thus benefits from
all the flexibility that the Context module provides.

Before setting up this module, make sure SSL is enabled and fully configured on
your web server and that the "https version" of your URL is correctly pointing
to your Drupal website.

Maintainer: Henrique Recidive (http://drupal.org/user/12564)
