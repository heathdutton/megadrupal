Prediction game
---------------

After enabling the module, go to "Administration » Content » Prediction games »
Teams" and create some teams. Then, you can create one or more competitions on
which people can then bet.

After creating a new competition, you should probably put a link to it somewhere
on your site (e.g., in some menu), so users will find it.
