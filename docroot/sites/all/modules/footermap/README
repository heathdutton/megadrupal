 1. Installation

    * Extract the files to the appropriate location (sites/all/modules) on your web server.
    * Enable the module on the modules page (admin/modules)

 2. Configuration

    * Go to the footermap settings page (admin/structure/footermap)

    * Recurse Limit
       * The recurse limit is the menu depth for every menu item.
       * By default footermap will crawl through each enabled menu, and display each menu 
         item in the footer.

    * Enable Menu Heading
       * This will provide the menu name as a header above each menu item list.
       * You can override footermap's theme functions in order to change, which part of
         the array is considered a header by changing #theme to "footermap_header".

    * Drupal Root Menu
       * Input which mlid you would like to start grabbing menus from.  This is useful if
         you only want to grab from one unique menu tree other than Primary Links, 
         Secondary Links, or a top custom menu.
       * By default footermap will use your Drupal installation's highest level menu mlid
         (usually 0).

    * Available Menus
       * Check which of the top menu blocks you wish to enable.
       * NOTE: if you do not have any menu items this will be blank.  Create a menu item,
         and then go back to the settings page and click Save Configuration.

    * Enable System Menu Items
       * Toggles between displaying items defined as being part of the 'system' core module. This is bad, but due to a bug in Drupal core is necessary to display views-generated menu items unfortunately.
       * You should only use this option when you have specifically controlled views menu items in certain trees, and not for Navigation menu items.

 3. Theming

    * Each primary menu that you enable is rendered in a div tag, and each of the children
      included are passed through Drupal's theme_link function.

    * By default, footermap will use footermap.css. You can add a float attribute to
      the footermap-col class in order to keep everything on one line. This all
      depends on the number of items in your footermap. You may need to play with the
      width tag to get things how you want them.

    * Classes:
       * footermap: in the footermap div wrapper
       * footermap-col: in each primary menu wrapper
          * footermap-col-N
          * footermap-col-MENUNAME
       * footermap-item: in each unordered list tag
       * menu-N: in each unordered list item tag

    * You can completely ignore default theming by overriding template_preprocess_footermap,
      footermap.tpl.php, and/or theme_footermap_header. You need to watch out for caching
      in the former if you do override it.

 4. Troubleshooting

    * White Screen
       * NOTE: This means that there has been a php error. Please consult your apache/iis
         error logs. I cannot help with this issue without error logs.
       * This could be a memory issue.

    * Views
       * You can turn on views menu items with the "Enable System Menu Items" option,
         but this will enable all system menu items. There is no finer grain control than
         this.
