Documentation for the Project Management suite of modules for Drupal:
- Project homepage: http://drupal.org/project/pm
- Issue tracking: http://drupal.org/project/issues/pm

--

Project Management consists of a set of modules as follows:
- Project Management (base module)
- Organizations
- Projects
- Tasks
- Tickets
- Timetrackings
- People
- Notes
- Invoices
- Expenses

Each of these provides permissions to control the sharing of data with other
users and organizations.
NB: This may conflict with other node access modules.

All components are nodes, so can be extended as follows:

    * Fields can be used to add more fields to the Project Management 
    content types
    * Views can build customised views
    * Taxonomy can be used to tag the contents of the Project Management nodes
    * Upload can be used to attach files to Project Management nodes
    * Comments can be used to permit comments on each of the Project 
    Management nodes

Project Management content nodes also all link together - for example, an 
invoice can be associated with an organization and project.

SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS OF EACH OF THE MODULES INCLUDED WITHIN THE PROJECT 
MANAGEMENT PACKAGE.
