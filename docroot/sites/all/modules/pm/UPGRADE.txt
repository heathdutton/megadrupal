UPGRADE NOTES (7.x-1.x -> 7.x-2.x):

* Integration with Drupal user accounts:

  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x integrates with Drupal user accounts and no longer defines
  a PM Person content type.

* Field API:

  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x uses the Drupal Field API to define node fields, rather
  than implementing its own database storage.

* Permission changes:

  The following permissions are present in the 7.x-1.x version, but are not
  present in the 7.x-2.x version. Those permissions are obsolete because
  Drupal PM 7.x-2.x integrates with Drupal user accounts and no longer defines
  a PM Person content type.
