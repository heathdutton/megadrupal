Drupal PM (Project Management)

INSTALLATION:

1) Copy this directory into the /sites/all/modules directory of your 
Drupal installation.
(Multisite installations may wish to use a different directory - see 
http://drupal.org/node/53705)

2) Enable Project Management (and whatever sub-modules of Project Management
that you wish), by visiting http://example.com/admin/build/modules. You will
(almost) always need 'Project Management' and 'PM Organization'.


CONFIGURATION:

- Set up permissions: Initially, it is recommended that you allow full access
for your administrative role, and allow more once you are familiar with the
system.

- There are a number of settings forms linked from 
http://example.com/admin/config/pm.

After installation, you should visit these pages and choose settings
appropriate for you.


DISABLING / UNINSTALL:

1) Visit http://example.com/admin/build/modules in your web-browser and
deselect the modules that you wish to disable. To uninstall, select the
uninstall tab and follow the on screen instructions.

2) Warnings may appear on disabling stating that nodes have not been deleted.
This is because several of the Project Management modules use the existing
Drupal node system to store information. Therefore, on disabling the module,
these nodes are not deleted.

It is suggested that you may wish to delete these manually by visiting 
http://example.com/admin/content/node and filtering by the stated content type.


HELP:

- It is understandable that Project Management may appear intimidating at 
first glance due to the number of modules in the package. Do not be afraid!
