Description
-----------
HTML Title allows a limited set of HTML markup to be used in node titles.
Title markup is stripped from RSS feeds to eliminate unsightly markup in feed
readers.

Benefits
--------
Drupal node titles are restrictive and do not support italicized text or
superscript text (e.g., Book titles, trademark symbols). This module enables
markup used to italicize, bold, subscript, or superscript text in titles.


Installation
------------
HTML Title can be installed like any other Drupal module; place it in
the modules directory for your site and enable it.
