Using Features

Safari Web Push - Simply activate the Roost for Drupal module. When your
site is viewed in a push-enabled browser, the browser will prompt for
permission. No additional setup is needed.

Auto Push is what makes this module stellar. When you create
a new post, your post's title and link will be sent to all of your subscribed
readers. That's it. Really. You don't have to do anything else. (It works
just like magic.) When enabled, an auto push override check box is also
placed on your post's admin page. If for some reason you do not want a
notification to go out for that post, just check the box when publishing.

Send Manual Alert - You can send a manual alert to all subscribed users by
entering your message text in the "Notification Text" box and a link in
the "Notification Link" box.

Roost Analytics & Roost JS - Metrics are provided in the dashboard.
These metrics include subscribers, notifications sent, and clicks.
