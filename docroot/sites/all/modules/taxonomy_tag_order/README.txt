Taxonomy Orderable Tags adds an autocomplete widget for taxonomy term reference
fields that creates a textfield for each entered tag and allows to re-order them
by using tabledrag multifield functionality

This module is useful if the order of terms attached to a node is essential and
autocomplete / free tagging is required
