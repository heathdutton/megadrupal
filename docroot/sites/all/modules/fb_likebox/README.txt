-- SUMMARY --

Simple module that provides a block with the latest updates from Facebook for
the provided account. It is based on the Page Plugin:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin. The widget
settings are configurable directly in the block  and they are available for 
users with 'administer blocks' permission.

-- FROM FACEBOOK LIKEBOX TO PAGE PLUGIN --

Facebook announced the old Facebook Likebox social plugin will be deprecated after 
the 23th of June 2015. New branches were developed for this new plugin: 7.x-2x and 
6.x-2.x respectively. The naming of the module "fb_likebox" in the code will remain
since this is the name of the project at Drupal.org itself.
