ngApp 7.x-1.6, 2015-06-10
=========================
by tea.time: Merged Angular callback menu items to single path 'ngapp/%' - this
  variable arg allows modules to generate different custom responses via
  hook_ngapp_response()
by natemow: Added new drupalSettings service to wrap access to the global
  Drupal.settings object.
by natemow: Added Angular app name as 'id' attribute on body element, to support
  IE8 with Angular version 1.2.x and lower, if desired.
