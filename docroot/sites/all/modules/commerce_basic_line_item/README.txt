DESCRIPTION
-----------

Add a basic line item to an order through the admin interface.

You can add an arbitrary amount and quantity directly to an order
without creating a product.


INSTALLATION
------------

1) Place this module directory in your "modules" folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/"). Don't install your module in Drupal core's "modules"
   folder, since that will cause problems and is bad practice in general. If
   "sites/all/modules" doesn't exist yet, just create it.

2) Enable the module.

3) Visit "admin/commerce/orders" to add basic line items to your orders.
