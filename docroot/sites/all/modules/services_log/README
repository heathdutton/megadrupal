This module provides logging for all Services requests.  It is intended for use
with the REST server and was written primarily with that in mind, but I'm
accepting patches to deal properly with other servers.

Administration is controlled through two variables: "services_log_enable" and
"services_log_max_requests".  Setting "services_log_enable" to a non-zero value
will enable logging on a site.  It is disabled by default.  Setting
"services_log_max_requests" to a postive int will cause Serivces Log to delete
any log entries when the number of entries exceeds a certain threshold.  By
default, no entries will be deleted.


TODO:
 * per-endpoint logging settings
 * support for other Services servers
 * better watchdog message:
   "Request to action 'login' of the 'user' resource on endpoint 'quux_api' returned 200."
 * better README
