Video Embed AOL
=====================

This module provides integration for AOL ON video network with
"Video Embed Field" module.

USAGE
=====================

Use this field type as usual video field provided by "Video Embed Field".
The example of correct AOL ON video url should looks like this:
http://on.aol.com/video/kendall-jenner-accused-of-throwing-money-at-her-waitress-518365417
http://on.aol.com/video/buffalo-billion--why-an-nfl-franchise-is-getting-low-balled-518364920

Also, you can use video ID instead of URL.
To achieve this, in field settings set 'Use video ID instead of URL'
(instance section) to "Yes". That's is. Now field accepts the video ID
instead of video URL.
