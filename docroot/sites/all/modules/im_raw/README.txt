im_raw.module

This module allows you to enter ImageMagick command line options as an image effect.

imagemagick.module is required:
http://drupal.org/project/imagemagick

Take a look at http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/ to get an idea of the sort of things you can do.

There's a permission that will deny users the ability to access the form to edit the commands, so check the permission is enabled for any role you want to have access.

Ensure that no WYSIWYG editors are enabled on the im_raw command text aread when editing the image style.
