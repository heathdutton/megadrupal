This module will do nothing by itself and requires the maestro module to be installed first.
The Maestro module is a workflow engine/solution that allows you to automate simple to complex business processes.

To install this module, copy the module folder and it's contents to the maestro/modules folder.
Assuming you have installed the maestro module under sites/all/modules then you should have a
sites/all/modules/maestro/modules/maestro_entityform_task directory after copying.

The module can then be enabled and is listed under the maestro project grouping.

Once enabled, you will have a new task type available when creating or editing your maestro workflow template.
