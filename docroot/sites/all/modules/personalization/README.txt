Welcome to the Personalization module.

The personalization module adds highly configurable implicit and explicit 
personalization to Drupal websites based on geolocation and taxonomies. It's 
designed for larger content heavy sites but would work effectively on any. It 
comes with a "Suggested content" block and paginated listing but the intention 
is for developers to call the modules functions directly to retrieve users 
suggested content to do with as they please.

Installing the module:

You must also enable the core Taxonomy module to use Personalization
