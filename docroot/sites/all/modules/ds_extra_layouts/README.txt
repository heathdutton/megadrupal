This module adds additional layouts for Display Suite. Although it’s very 
simple to create your own layouts and include them in the theme. I decided to 
build a collection of these extra layouts and make them easy to access 
regardless of the theme you are using.

If you are using Bootstrap you’ll want to use Display Suite Bootstrap Layouts 
instead of this one.


New Layouts
===========

Two Column 33/66
Two Column 66/33
Two Column Stacked 33/66
Two Column Stacked 66/33
Two Column Bricks
Three Column Stacked Nested Left
Three Column Stacked Nested Right
Three Column Bricks
Four Column Bricks

** Please suggest your layouts in the issue queue.


Installation
============

Install this module as you would any other contributed module 
(https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7). Once 
enabled you will find the extra layouts available in the same place you find 
all the default Display Suite layouts. This module does not provide any 
additional UI, it only contains layouts.


Additional Info
===============

Find additional information about Display Suite in it's section of the 
documentation https://drupal.org/node/644662.
