This modules provides the ability to rotate images in IMCE.
If assigned the rotate permission in their IMCE profiles,
users can choose 90 deg clockwise, 90 counterclockwise or
180 degrees. Users can choose to make a copy of the rotated
image, in which case the image will be assigned to that
user through the file management system. Otherwise, images
will maintain their relationship to the original contributor.

IMCE Rotate was originally adapted by 
J. Branson Skinner for http://theor.org based on IMCE Crop
and an unpublished D6 version of this module
(https://drupal.org/node/538038) contributed by NAX
(https://drupal.org/user/25511).
