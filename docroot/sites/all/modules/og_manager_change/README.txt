INTRODUCTION
------------

Current Maintainer: Joe Haskins (jhaskins) - http://drupal.org/user/1358434

This extends Organic Groups to allow the manager of a group to select a new 
manager for their group (ie if they want to leave the group). This eliminates 
the need to request site admin involvement or have the "Administer Content" 
permission.


INSTALLATION
------------
* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


USAGE
-----
This module adds a new "Manager" link on the "Group" tab.  Clicking the link 
will take you to a page where you can select a new manager.
