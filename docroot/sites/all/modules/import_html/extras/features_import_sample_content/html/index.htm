  <h1>Content deployed by import_html feature</h1>
<div id="content">
  <p>Simple content here</p>
  <p>This content was deployed as files and <em>bundled as part of a feature</em> 
  so it was distributed with the module itself. 
  This method could be used to allow a feature to deploy actual content, like
  placeholder pages for a site structure
  </p>
  <p>We should be able to <a href="page1.htm">link to nearby pages</a>
  with relative links in the source docs, 
  and have them updated when the content comes into the Drupal context.</p>
