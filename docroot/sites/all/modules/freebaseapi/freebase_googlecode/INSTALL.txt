This requires Google API library support and a Google API key

There are two modules that also do this, but neither adds much value where
needed, so they are not required dependencies. Though if installed, the UI
may be better.

THESE 2 ARE *NOT* REQUIRED:

https://drupal.org/project/google_api
  This has a tool to get the third-party code from google
  drush google-api-get 

https://drupal.org/project/gauth
  Is focussed on OAuth credentials and logins to registered account services.
  Reading from Freebase does not require this, and it gets in the way,
  though it does ensure the Google API library is available.


Install the google-api-php-client yourself
------------------------------------------

Find the latest code, download it and unpack it under 'sites/all/libraries'
Latest version at https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/

  cd sites/all/libraries
  wget https://google-api-php-client.googlecode.com/files/google-api-php-client-0.6.7.tar.gz
  tar -xzf google-api-php-client-0.6.7.tar.gz

HOWEVER, note that the 2013 version of Freebase in that package is broken.
THIS module provides an updated alternative. See below.

OPTIONAL Activate a Google API key
-------------------------

This is OPTIONAL for read-only requests!
This is described at https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/getting-started
(2013) 
You have to be registered and visit https://cloud.google.com/console
Under "APIs and Auth" it should be labelled "Freebase API" and enabled there.
Your API key should be found in your activated account labelled 
"Public API Access"

Configure the API key
---------------------

Not yet supported.

Google code is broken
---------------------
As at 2013-12, the library provided at 
  https://google-api-php-client.googlecode.com/
is unusable. It seems to have been modified to /remove/ some required functions
and now cannot even be instantiated per the documentation. It looks like these
required funcs (Google_ImageServiceResource, Google_MqlreadServiceResource)
were left behind in a renaming purge, but never replaced, and then the old ones
were deleted as unused.
  https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/source/diff?path=/trunk/src/contrib/Google_FreebaseService.php&format=side&r=578
Traces of the original functions were found in the open-source code at
https://github.com/mashery/io-wraps-usatoday-php/blob/master/google-api-php-client/src/contrib/apiFreebaseService.php
and could be traced back through the version control history.

To recover from this regression, a new patched copy of the 
Google_FreebaseService is needed.
This module, when including the libraries using the function 
  freebase_api_get_freebase()
will load the base Googlecode libraries, but use the lcal patched version of 
Google_FreebaseService
The local version tries to fill in the gaps left when the code was abandoned 
in an unfinished state in the public repo.
