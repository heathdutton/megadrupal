Token Menu Render
=================

Create automatic tokens for every menu in the system.

To use these tokens, simply use tokens like this:
[menu:main-menu]
[menu:navigation]
[menu:MY-CUSTOM-MENU-MACHINE-NAME]

To unlock the full potential of the module, use it together with Token Filter
module (https://drupal.org/project/token_filter).
