INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a Views style plugin to display Views results as cells in a table,
grouping by row and column.
For example, you might generate a conference schedule by grouping rows by a
time slot field and columns by a room or track field.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Views (https://drupal.org/project/views) is not set as a requirement but it
makes no sense to install this module without ist because it's only providing
a style plugin for views and doesn't provide any further functionality

INSTALLATION
------------
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
for further information.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Because this module provides a display plugin for views. There is only some
configuration when it's used inside a view configuration.
