# See https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/php/config/cron.
#
# In order to use, the cron_key variable must be filled in with the value for
# the Drupal site for which the cron is to be run. Simply visit
# admin/config/system/cron and copy everything after cron.php. The resulting
# path should look like the following /cron.php?cron_key=BLAHBLAH. Once
# configured the built-in cron should be set to 'never' since it should not need
# to run. Note that the two will not duplicate eachother since they will check
# when the last cron run was completed, but App Engine cron should be preferred
# if configured.
#
# The schedule may need to be customized to suite the needs of the site.

cron:
# Uncomment once cron_key is filled in.
