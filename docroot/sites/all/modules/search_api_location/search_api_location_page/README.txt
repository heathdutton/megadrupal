Search API location pages
-------------------------

This module adds location search capabilities to the Search API pages module.
When creating or editing a page, you will get additional options for all
fields indexed as "Latitude/longitude" (if the server's service class supports
the data type). Enable the location filters for fields to get an additional
proximity filter based on a fixed or user-entered distance for the searches via
that page.
