7.x-1.0-beta1 13/04/2013
========================

Beta release for testing and feedback. Please report any issues, and
preferrably provide patches.

Added Volume and Weight packing module. To use, enable the sub-module and then
configure the shipping method to use the new packing method instead of the
default Do Not Pack. More details in the packing/volume_weight/README.txt
file.

Also added the ability to adjust the returned quote rate prior to display to
the user, available on a per-method setting.

Australia Post changed their available services on the 8th of April 2013,
which meant updating the values provided in the default Glacial Cache.
Numerous changes to the interface were also included to more easily allow
users to revert to these values, and inform them of which values they were
currently using.

An update is provided to automatically update the values for users who did not
manually regenerate their Glacial cache. A warning is provided for users who
may have out of date services cached, and a new button to revert the cache to
the default values.
