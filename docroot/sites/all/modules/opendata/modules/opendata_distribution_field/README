Project Open Data Download URL Field
====================================

This module provides Drupal with a basic custom field that includes two data
elements per "row", format and access_url. These fields are described as
"Download URL" and "Format" here: http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/
and they should be displayed as an array at /data.json like this:

        "distribution": [
            {   
                "accessURL": "https://explore.data.gov/views/ykv5-fn9t/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD",
                "format": "csv"
            },
            {   
                "accessURL": "https://explore.data.gov/views/ykv5-fn9t/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD",
                "format": "json"
            },
            {   
                "accessURL": "https://explore.data.gov/views/ykv5-fn9t/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD",
                "format": "xml"
            }
        ],
