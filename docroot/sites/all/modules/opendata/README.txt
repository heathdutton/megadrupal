More Info about the Open Data Policy
-----------------

In May of 2013, the White House issued an executive order stating that formats
on all US Government websites need be machine-readable (i.e., data are
reasonably structured to allow automated processing).

Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons
and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range
of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To
the extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly
available, and no restrictions should be placed upon their use.
