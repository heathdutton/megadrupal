## Panopoly Event Feature

Panopoly Event provides event registration integration via the (Entity) Registration module. This Feature creates a content type for an event with user registration on your site. Registration is managed and customized through the Entity Registration module. 

Panopoly Event provides an easy way to create signups events on your Drupal 7 site with various customizations to improve usability in Panopoly-based sites. 

* Main Depencency: Registration
* Additional Dependencies: It is recommended that you install this on an existing Panopoly site but it should also work on any panels and panelizer powered site. 

## Panopoly Event Demo Feature

This module also includes a demo feature that will create a sample event page for signup and a basic event homepage that could be further customized via Pages and/or Panelizer

Note about Demo depencencies: The demo feature currently depends on defaultcontent module, which is not how the current version of Panopoly manages demo content (See: https://drupal.org/node/1869972). Current work is being done to fix this here: [#2204433]
