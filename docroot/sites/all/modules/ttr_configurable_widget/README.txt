Overview:
-------------------

TTR Configurable Widget is a flexible, configurable widget 
for use with taxonomy term reference fields. 
By default users can choose between 'Select List' and 'Checkboxes' 
as the available widgets, whereas with with TTR Configurable Widget 
users are now able to choose additional, more advanced options.

Due to it's extensibility it is very easy for other developers to add 
further options. The module provides additional back-end options which 
allows users to filter and order taxonomy term options within a field 
and gives the admin control over how taxonomy term fields are listed 
in a form. Developers can then extend the widget by creating their own 
front-end variations which utilise this functionality.

Instructions:
-------------------
When creating or editing a taxonomy term field select 
the TTR Configurable Widget as the widget option.
You can then edit the widget settings that are located in the 
`TTR CONFIGURATION SETTINGS` fieldset.

You can choose to display a number of options or all options.

Option ordering will decide how options are listed on the node form.

Choose the `view type` depending on how you would like the options to
be displayed on the form. More view types can be added. By default there
are a `select list` choce and a `checkboxes/radio` one.
Try the Wordwall view type that is included in this module. This must be
enabled separately.
