Overview:
-------------------
This module extends the TTR Configurable Widget module to add a `view type`.

How it works:
-------------------
Word Wall is simple to use. Simply click on the options you want to select. 
These will be highlighted. If there is a limit set of the number of chooseable 
values, the list will be frozen. To unselect an item simply click it again, 
if the list was frozen it will become unfrozen and the other options will 
become selectable again.
