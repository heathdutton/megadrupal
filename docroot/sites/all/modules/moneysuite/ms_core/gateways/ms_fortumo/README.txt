MS Fortumo allows you to sell credits on your site via SMS payments, and users
can then use those credits to purchase other products on your site.

You can also set it up so that products can be linked to certain shortcodes,
so that users are granted the product when they pay to the shortcode.

Fortumo doesn't allow dynamic pricing, so it cannot be used during checkout
like other payment gateway modules.
