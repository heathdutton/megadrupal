Description:
------------

The Product Kit module is a front-end to the ms_products API in MS Core, which
allows you to create custom products from the admin pages. You can set the recurring
schedule and override settings, as well as emails.

Once the product is created, you are shown an add to cart link for that product,
which you can then copy and paste into any HTML page to let users purchase the product.

There is Rules integration so that you can automatically react and deliver the
product once it is purchased.

This is an extremely powerful module that can allow you to create your own custom
products with enough configuration. The possibilities really are limitless!
