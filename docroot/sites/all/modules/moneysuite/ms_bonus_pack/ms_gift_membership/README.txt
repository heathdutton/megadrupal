Description:
------------

The Gift Memberships module allows you to let your users purchase 'Gift Memberships'
for a friend.

They go to www.yoursite.com/gift/membership to fill out the gift
information, including the recipient name, email, delivery date and a message,
and then proceed to checkout to pay for the gift membership.

The recipient is sent an email informing them of the gift and where they can go
to redeem it. They redeem their gifts at the www.yoursite.com/gift/redeem page.
