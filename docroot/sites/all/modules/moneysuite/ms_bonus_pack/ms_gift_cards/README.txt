Description:
------------

The Gift Cards module allows you to generate and distribute gift card codes which
can be printed on gift cards or just sent in emails, etc. The codes have statuses
which determine the state of the card. The statuses are as follows:

Dormant - This is the first state, and it means the card is created but not activated yet.
Printed - This is a way for the admin to keep track of which cards have been printed
  or distributed already.
Activated - This means the card is ready for redemption. It is 'live'. Affiliates and other
  users can go to www.yoursite.com/activate to activate gift cards (for a price). Or you
  can give out cards that are already activated.
Redeemed - This means the card has been redeemed by a customer and can't be used anymore.
  The users redeem their cards from www.yoursite.com/giftcard

Using this module, you are able to generate any number of giftcards which are associated
with a MoneySuite product (for example, a membership from Membership Suite, or a
file from File Downloads Suite). You can then export those card codes to CSV files
and distribute them how you like.
