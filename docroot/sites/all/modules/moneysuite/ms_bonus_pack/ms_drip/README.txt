Description:
------------

The Drip Content module allows you to create Drip Sets which contain Drip Set Items
which can contain any Rules action. This makes it extremely powerful.

So using Drip Content, you are able to set up Drip Sets like the following:

Set Name: My Piano Lessons
Day 1: Send welcoming email
Day 7: Release access to a Pay Per View node
Day 9: Send another email and release access to a new node

Once you have a Drip Set created, you can use Rules to start or schedule a Drip
Set for a user using Rules. For example, you could start the drip set above for
a user when they purchase your 'Piano Student' membership. Or you could start it
when the users publish a node, or any of the other Rules events.
