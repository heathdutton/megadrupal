Requirements:
-------------
-Drupal 7
-Affiliates Suite

Description:
------------
Marketplace Suite enables you to create a 'marketplace' where your users can
list and sell products of their own, and earn a commission whenever someone
purchases their products. You can set the amount of commission they should
receive, as well as the terms for when and how payout will be made.

Affiliates Suite allows you to pay affiliate via PayPal and even has support
for the MassPay API, allowing you to pay all of your sellers with one click.
Sellers can also view reports about which products are selling best, and how
much money they have earned over time.

With MS Pay Per View, users can publish content and charge others to view it.
This is a great combination because it is easy to set up and monetize.

Installation:
-------------
Install the module just like you would any other Drupal Module
