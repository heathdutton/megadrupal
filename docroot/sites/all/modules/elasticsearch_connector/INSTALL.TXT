This module requires to install the needed PHP extensions, otherwise it will 
not works correctly. There are two ways to install them:

 * Install the "Elasticsearch Connector Easy Install" module, packing the 
libraries for you. In this way the upgrade of the libraries is much more 
harder instead of using the composer and composer manager to do this.
However it is a great starting point if you do not want to deal with libraries,
for click/install/play. 

OR YOU CAN

 * Use composer_manager module - https://drupal.org/project/composer_manager. 
This module handle the requirements by looking the composer.json file. 
Learn more about the composer at here: 
https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/00-intro.md
After you configure the composer_manager module, go to the 
composer folder where the json file is generated. The default path will be: 
sites/default/files/composer and execute the composer install file e.g.: 

cd [DRUPAL ROOT]/sites/default/files/composer;
composer.phar install;

If the above command is not available in CLI go to:
https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/00-intro.md 
and follow the install instructions.
