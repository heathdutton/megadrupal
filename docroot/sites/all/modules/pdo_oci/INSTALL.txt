CREATE THE Oracle DATABASE
--------------------------

This file describes how to create a Oracle database for Drupal.

If you control your databases through a web-based control panel,
check its documentation, as the following instructions are for the
command line only.

This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database
set-up (e.g. by your host). In the following examples, 'dba_user' is
an example Oracle user which has the CREATE and GRANT privileges. Use
the appropriate user name for your system.

Optionally, you can create a new tablespace for your Drupal site
datebase. Log into sqlplus by following command:

  sqlplus dba_user

sqlplus will prompt for the 'dba_user' database password. At the
sqlplus prompt, enter following command:

  CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace_name
  DATAFILE 'file_directory_path'
  SIZE filesize AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT extend_size;

where

  'tablespace_name' is the name of you new tablespace
  'file_directory_path' is the file location in database server
  'filesize' is the initial file size, e.g. 50K, 1000M.
  'extend_size' is the volumn for extension when data file is full

First, you must create a new user for your Drupal site. At the
sqlplus prompt, enter the following command:

  CREATE USER username
  IDENTIFIED BY "password";
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE tablespace_name;
  GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO username;

where

  'tablespace_name' is the name of you tablespace
  'username' is the username of your Oracle account
  'password' is the password required for that username

   Note: Unless your database user has all of the privileges listed
   above, you will not be able to run Drupal.

Oracle SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
