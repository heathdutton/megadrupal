name = Crowd Bruteforce Protection
description = This module uses Crowd based IP Bruteforce Login protection to protect your site.  People in the crowd report IP's as having failed a login and if other crowd sources report the same IP as having failed a login then the IP is banned over the entire Crowd Bruteforce Protection network (your site included).  So people seeing other bruteforce attempts will in turn protect your site before the bad guys ever even show up on your website to do their dirty work.  You can also request to have a specific IP banned for other reasons as well, but these reports are crowd sourced, so no one source can cause a ban.  If you inadvertantly lock yourself out of your own website, you can request to have your IP unbanned by entering your drupal site owner email into our server's reset form and we will email you a reset link.  Click that link and your site will be unlocked.  They form can be found on our main website http://crystaldawn.net:6980 (yes the 6980 port is required, I dont want the server being hit on port 80 for performance reasons, this may change in the future if I find traffic is not all that bad on 80 with all the crap that worms spew on port 80 when looking for vuln sites)  It's just a form, nothing fancy just like this module is nothing fancy.  Its very small and 'just works'.  I try to keep the bloat down as much as possible for performance reasons.
