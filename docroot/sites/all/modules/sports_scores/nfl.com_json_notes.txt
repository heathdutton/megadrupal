Hi, Justin,

I've been working on my own NFL picks module and thought I'd share some info with you after finding your Sports Scores module.

In sports_scores.inc, you've got some UNKNOWN entries in your notations for the scorestrip.json from NFL.com and I've figured them out if you're interested:

(These update/change as the game is in progress)
3 => Time Left in current quarter
8 => Team with ball possession
9 => Red Zone indicator (if #8 above is in the 'Red Zone')
11 => Recent Score method ("TD", "FG" - haven't seen a safety abbreviation yet)
(Also, #11 is only populated for a limited time, which I guess is about 30 seconds, but haven't tested it)



The ss.xml that NFL.com uses is structured similar, though it adds and removes a couple depending on if the game is ongoing or not.

Here's what I've got for the attributes for each "g" tag in order:
eid= Event ID (4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day & 2-digit game number for that day)
gsis= Game ID system number
d= Day of week
t= Game time (Eastern Time Zone)
q= Quarter (or "F" for Final, "P" for Pregame, and I assume "FOT" for Final Overtime?)
k= Time left in current quarter (not shown at all if game is final or hasn't started)
h= Home team abbrev.
hnn= Home team nickname
hs= Home team score
v= Visiting team abbrev.
vnn= Visiting team nickname
vs= Visiting team score
p= Team abbrev with ball possession (not shown at all if game is final or hasn't started)
rz= Red Zone indicator
ga= Recent scoring method (blank string after limited time)

It will also ad a "b" tag with recent "Big Play" info at times after the closing "gms" tag enclosed between "bps" tags.

Anyway, I didn't know if you had been retrieving the json or xml and observing them while games were ongoing, but they provide decent actual live updates and I thought the info might be useful to you and your Sports Scores module. ;)


I forgot that in the scorestrip.json, the third entry in the array can contain a "1", "2", "3", "4" or "OT" (indicating quarter) in addition to "Pregame", "Final" or the indicator for final overtime (FOT??)

I was watching Sunday during the games and updated the following:

In scorestrip.json:
2 => "Pregame", "1", "2", "Halftime", "3", "4", "5" (for OT), "Final" or "final overtime"

Also, the 12th value ([11]), so far I've found "TD", "FG" and "INT", so it's not just a recent score, but recent action. Didn't catch a fumble ("FUM"???) or safety or anything yet and won't know what other ones they use until it happens in a game.


The ss.xml versions are:
q=   ("P", "1", "2", "H", "3", "4", "5", "F" or "FO")
ga=  (So far looks like the same abbrevs in [11] of scorestrip.json)

(I figure that "ga" stands for "Game Action" most likely)
