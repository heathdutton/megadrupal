Taxonomy Add Previous
=====================

This module improves the UX of adding lots of taxonomy terms at once by
allowing the form for the next, new term to be presented with the values from
the previously added term.

This is particularly of use when building up a vocabulary where terms have
many fields, many of whose values are repeated as terms are added sequentially.
