if you changed them.

Beta2
-----
 * Added option to hide sort header.
 * Added option to use currency format for item's price.
 * HTML code of vertical orientation a little bit changed in couple with
   CSS table - improved apperance especially if formatted price used.
 * Improved calculation of width and height of scrolling area for horizontal

After update if module doesn't work properly you should deactivate and activate
it again. Clear cache is good idea too.
