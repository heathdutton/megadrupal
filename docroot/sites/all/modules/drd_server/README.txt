* -- IMPORTANT --                                                             *
*                                                                             *
* To allow DRD to automatically install and setup this module remotely,       *
* you should move the file drd_server.install.php.txt to your Drupal root     *
* and rename it to drd_server.install.php                                     *
*                                                                             *
* If you do not want to support automatic installation - even not for new     *
* domains on this server - then you can leave the file as is. Just remember   *
* then, that you have to enable this module manually before you can manage    *
* it remotely.                                                                *
*                                                                             *
* -- IMPORTANT TOO --                                                         *
*                                                                             *
* Once you enabled this module on one of your sites, there will be a path     *
* www.domain.com/?q=admin/drd_server/% publicly accessible which return just a*
* number and do nothing else. However, it discloses the fact that drd_server  *
* is installed and if you don't like that, you should overwrite the access    *
* control for 'admin/drd_server/%' in a custom module.                        *
*                                                                             *
