REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------
None.



INSTALLATION
------------
1. Download the Stitchz Social Login module.

   You can obtain the latest release from https://www.drupal.org/node/2321765 
   -- the files are available in .tar.gz and .zip formats.

2. Create a new directory in your Drupal "modules" directory. 

3. Extract the files into the newly created directory.

4. Verify all the files have been extracted successfully. 

5. Login as an administrator and go to the Drupal "Modules" page. 

6. Scroll down to the Stitchz Social Login section. Tick the checkbox next to
   each available module. 

7. Click "Save configuration".

8. Go to the "Configuration" page, then in the "People" section click on 
   "Stitchz Social Login".



CONFIGURATION
------------
Before using Stitchz Social Login, you must setup an application at: 
https://login.stitchz.net/. Once you application has been setup, continue with
the steps below.

1. Copy your App Url, ApiKey, AppSecret, and Return Url from your Stitchz 
   application into the appropriate fields in the Stitchz Social Login API 
   Settings form. All fields with a red asterisks (*) are required.

2. The "Return Url" is your Drupal website's full web address plus the Stitchz 
   Drupal end point ('/stitchz_social_login/auth'), i.e. 
   https://www.yourwebsiteaddress.com/stitchz_social_login/auth

3. Select the API Version to run. The "Standard Login" option is a basic 
   authentication request used to only authenticate a user. The "OAuth 2 Login" 
   option sends an OAuth 2.0 authenticated request to the Stitchz API and 
   returns a valid OAuth 2.0 token.

4. Confirm your Stitchz Login API Settings before moving on to the next section.

5. Click the "Sync Providers" button to synchronize your provider list 
   configured in your Stitchz application with your Drupal instance. If all 
   settings are correct a sample login will display with all your configured and
   active identity providers. Check the README.txt file if any errors occur.
   
6. Enable/disable any login forms where the Stitchz Social Login links are 
   displayed. By default the links are visible on all available forms.

7. The "Social Login Notes" field can contain up to 255 letters or numbers in 
   plain text and will be displayed under the social login links.

8. Clic Save.



OPTIONS
--------
A standalone Stitchz Social Login block can be added to any page in addition to
the standard login forms. It can be added by going to Administration » 
Structure » Blocks and setup as any other Drupal block.
