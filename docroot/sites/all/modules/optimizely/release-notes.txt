September 2014 - 7.x-2.16

- Issue: 2330675 - Broken links on Account Info tab
    Link to Optimizely site to purchase upgrade to Optimizely was broken.
    Applied patch supplied by tz_earl
- Issue: 2324367 - Remove unnecessary .DS_Store files
    Applied patch supplied by tz_earl
- Issue: 2323041 - OptimizelyTestPageSnippetTestCase fails in multiple ways.
    Didin't apply patch as related code was fixed / enhanced but still provided
    commit credit as the solution was still helpful. Applied patch supplied by tz_earl
- Issue: 2321035 - Automated test fails for js snippet insertion using aliases
    Basic test works but needs further development.
    Applied patch supplied by tz_earl
- Issue 2307281 - Ajax calls fail for form checkboxes
    Raises need for test coverage of AJAX functionality. The D7 simpletest
    functionality does not cover this need but it appears it exists in D8 based
    on the work being done by tz_earl

- AJAX endpoint from /ajax/optimizely to admin/config/system/optimizely/ajax
  as permissions on /ajax were not set resulting in the access arguments being
  lost due to inheritance.
- Added test coverage to AJAX endpoint using cURL
