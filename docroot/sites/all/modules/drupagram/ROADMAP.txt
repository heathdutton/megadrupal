This is a list of features we want to implement to make the drupagram module 
more robust and useful.

1. SSO using Instagram's OAuth.
   This will be a submodule called drupagram_signin and will allow users to
   authenticate on this site using their Instagram credentials.
   Use case: Ideal for a photography club website.
