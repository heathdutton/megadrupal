UPGRADING FROM DRUPAL 6
-----------------------

It is important you follow these steps when upgrading from Drupal 6 to
Drupal 7. As always: Do backups to avoid data loss!

 1. Synchronize

    Before you upgrading Drupal core, make sure the profile field and the
    Birthdays table are in sync.

 2. Upgrade Drupal core

    Upgrade Drupal core as usual. Your contrib modules will be disabled at that
    point. Birthdays must be disabled, too.

 3. Remove the complete birthdays directory from sites/all/modules. Download
    the latest release of birthdays and place it there. Make sure no old files
    persist.

 4. Enable the required modules. If you have been using Triggers or Views
    upgrade them first, before you continue.

    * Enable the Triggers module, if you want to send users mails on their
      birthdays.

    * Enable the Birthdays module.

    * If you want to use the default Birthdays page or block, enable Birthdays
      Defaults and the Views module.

 5. Run update.php as usual.

    If you encounter problems, please report them in the issue queue
    (http://drupal.org/project/issues/birthdays) as detailed as you can. Once
    they are fixed you can go back using your backups and try again.

 6. Remove the duplicate profile field

    Your user entity type now has a birthdays field but it should still have
    the old profile field. Go to Configuration > People > Profiles if you want
    to delete that duplicate field.

 7. Manually deal with page / block settings and permissions

    Page / block settings as well as permissions aren't upgraded automatically.
    Configure your views manually and use the Field Permissions
    (http://drupal.org/project/field_permissions) if you need field level
    permissions for your birthday fields.

 8. Congrats, you're done.
