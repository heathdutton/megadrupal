See OVERVIEW.txt for a general introduction.

Some hints to remember:
- We want to let other modules inherit from all of our classes.
- Use camelcase at conceptual boundaries.
- For now  do not use SplFileInfo as a parent class for VersioncontrolItem, but maybe in near future when it's considered a need(maybe performance).
- The future of source items in the main API module (we want them as an optional bonus instead of a log-parse-time requirement).
