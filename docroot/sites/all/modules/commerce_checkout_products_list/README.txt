Commerce Checkout Products List
-------------------------------
Provides a checkout pane that lists all active products, allowing the visitor to
add & remove products from the current order. 

This module is a fork of the Commerce Cart Form Checkout Pane module [1]; that
module allows editing the products currently in the user's cart, whereas this
module shows all products.


Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once enabled, an item named "Product list / cart list (Form)" will be available
on the checkout configuration page (admin/commerce/config/checkout). On the
configuration page for this pane it will be possible to select the view to use,
which defaults to the "Defaults" i.e "master" display of the main "Products"
view, as is bundled with the Commerce Products module.

Note: As the default Products view includes active and inactive products, it is
recommended to create a new view specially for this list.

  Make visitors skip the cart page, taking them directly to the checkout page.
  Also allows a product to be automatically added to the cart if it is otherwise
  empty.
