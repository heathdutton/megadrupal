Overlay Light module

The admin overlay is very nice but on a heavy site with many modules can slow
things down. This module disables it but keeps the functionality of the overlay
which brings you back to the page you were before visiting an admin page.

Dependencies
============

Drupal 7

Install and Configure
=====================

1) Copy the overlay_light folder to the modules folder in your
installation. Usually this is sites/all/modules. Or use the UI and install
it via admin/modules/install.

2) You don't have to configure anything. The overlay module is disabled
automatically and the overlay_light module doesn't have any settings.
