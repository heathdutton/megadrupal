Activity Stream 7.x-3.0, 2012-09-04
-----------------------------------
 * Activity Stream 3.0 IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with Activity Stream 1.x!
 * Activity Stream 3.0 HAS NO UPGRADE PATH from Activity Stream 1.x!
 * Activity Stream 3.x doesn't have everything from the 2.0 betas. Yet.

 * The Activity Stream API has been rewritten.
  * The original 1.x API has been around since Drupal 5.x.
  * The new 3.x API is focussed on Drupal 7.x and what it already offers.
  * Most Activity Stream-specific hooks have been replaced with core hooks.
  * See activitystream.api.php for a full explanation of the new approach.

 * Modules can now handle more than one site or service.
  * In 1.x, a single module was responsible for only one site.
  * In 3.x, a module can respond to as many services as they'd like.
  * They can also alter items pulled down from other services.

 * Activity Stream gains a focus of forever-archiving your activity items.
  * Modules SHOULD save all the raw item data received from a service.
  * Theoretically, this allows us to always recreate an activity item...
   * ... even if the service is no longer offering it in their exports.
   * ... even if you didn't use all the data the first time.
   * ... even if the service is no longer around.

 * Activity Stream per-user account configuration has been overhauled.
  * In 1.x, modules could only save certain pieces of per-user account info.
  * In 3.x, modules can save as much as they want; nothing is hard-coded.
  * This means slightly more code for per-user I/O, but greater flexibility.

 * Activity Stream items are now full content types and Fields.
 * The Feed module now ships with SimplePIE 1.3. Yes, I can do that.
 * Higher-resolution icons have been added for today's awesomer screens.
 * Activity Stream display has clearer icons for local/external links.
 * Delicious, Digg, LastFM, and Flickr core support has been removed.
  * They'll likely return in a future release as Feed UI configurations.
 * activitystream/UID has moved to user/UID/activity-stream.
 * URLs are friendlier "activity-stream", not "activitystream".

 * Module maintainer has switched from Adam Kalsey to Morbus Iff.
