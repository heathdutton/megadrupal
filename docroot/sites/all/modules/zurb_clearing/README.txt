Zurb Clearing
=============

Prerequisite:

You will need the 2.x dev branch of the Media module. Since there is no stable release of 2.x, only 1.x is available - otherwise it would be listed
as a module dependency. Drush will always attempt to download 1.x when enabling it.

This will be corrected when 2.x has a stable release.

Also, you should be running Foundation 4.x or higher theme - as this plugin is meant to compliment it. Clearing is a Javascript plugin with the
Foundation framework.

Installation:

1. Enable Zurb Clearing module.

Configure display of an Image field to use ZURB Clearing, pick your thumbnail size image style and your larger image style for Clearing,
and you're good to go! You can even set what caption shows via Fields attached to the Image file entity - giving you flexibility in what
to display as a caption beyond just the image title. Setting 'featured' will set the first image in the set as the featured image - showing
only that image until you click it, revealing the gallery.
