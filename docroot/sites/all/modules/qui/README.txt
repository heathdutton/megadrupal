INTRODUCTION
------------
The Query UI (QUI) module is designed to give site owners a way to
query their database using an easy-to-use interface. The modules allows you to
build "reports" that can be viewed using different "formatters". A formatter is
essentially a theme function that can be registered with the module.

RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
entityfield: Allows you to embed reports in your content.
bean: Allows you to create fieldable blocks.
entity_view_modes: Allows you to manipulate entity view modes.
