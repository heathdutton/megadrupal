INFORMATION
-----------

Short title is a module that provides a secondary title field with a fixed
length. The aim of this is to allow site builds to enforce the editors to
provide a shorter version of a nodes title field that can be displayed in areas
of the site that require the title to be a specific max length.

The short title field is hidden on the node edit form by default and appears
only when the title field length exceeds that of the short titles max length.
Alterntively the field can be toggled by the user.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

1. Go to the content type administration page
   admin/structure/types/manage/%type

2. Select the "Enable short title field" checkbox

3. Now when editing a node of that content type the short title field
   functionality will be enabled.
