This module exposes the Password Recovery form as a Ctools 
plugin, allowing you to embed the form into panels as a widget.

Important Notes:
> When the module is enabled the original Password Recovery 
  page is disabled and a new tab on the Login form is created 
  that goes to a new URL (user/recover). This is a Ctools page 
  that can be configured/customized as easily as any other page using Panels.
> Also, all links that point to user/password are altered to 
  point to the new user/recover page.

Required Modules:
- Ctools
- Panels
