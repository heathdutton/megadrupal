 * Defines return states for use in grouping return statuses together.

 * An return state is a particular phase in the life-cycle of an return that is
 * comprised of one or more return statuses. In that regard, an return state is
 * little more than a container for return statuses with a default status per
 * state. This is useful for categorizing returns and advancing returns from one
 * state to the next without needing to know the particular status an return will
 * end up in.
 *
 * The Order module defines several return states in its own implementation of
 * this hook, commerce_return_commerce_return_state_info():
 * - Canceled: for returns that have been canceled through some user/admin
 *   action.
 * - Pending: for returns that have been created and are awaiting further
 *   action.
 * - Completed: for returns that have been completed as far as the customer
 *   should be concerned.
 *
 * The return state array structure is as follows:
 * - name: machine-name identifying the return state using lowercase alphanumeric
 *   characters, -, and _
 * - title: the translatable title of the return state, used in administrative
 *   interfaces
 * - description: a translatable description of the types of returns that would
 *   be in this state
 * - weight: integer weight of the state used for sorting lists of return states;
 *   defaults to 0
 * - default_status: name of the default return status for this state
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array of return state arrays keyed by name.

 * - Pending: default status of the Pending state; used to indicate the return
 *   has completed the return workflow and is awaiting further action before
 *   being considered complete (e.g.: customer has to return their products).
 * - Processing: additional status for the Pending state; used to indicate
 *   returns that have begun to be processed but are not yet completed
 * - Completed: default status of the Completed state; used for returns that
 *   donâ€™t require any further attention or customer interaction. (e.g.:
 *   Customer has been fully reimbursed.).

 * - name: machine-name identifying the return status using lowercase
 *   alphanumeric characters, -, and _
 * - title: the translatable title of the return status, used in administrative

 * - state: the name of the return state the return status belongs to
 * - cart: TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not returns with this status
 *   should be considered shopping cart returns
 * - weight: integer weight of the status used for sorting lists of return
 *   statuses; defaults to 0
