Tcmb module README file
-----------------------

What does Tcmb do?
---
Tcmb retrieves daily currency exchange codes from Turkish Republic Central Bank 
(TCMB) and displays them nicely in a table. Tcmb module also retrieves gold 
prices and displays them in another table.

How does it work?
---
Simple. Just enable the module at Admin > Modules, then go to Admin > Configuration
> Tcmb general settings and enable some currency codes as desired. Then move the
Tcmb block to any region you want at Admin > Structure > Block.

TODO:
---
Find a way to show past date's rate for a given currency.
Integrate views.

I'll try doing these when I have time.
