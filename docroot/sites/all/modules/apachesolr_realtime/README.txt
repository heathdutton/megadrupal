Introduction
====================
This module implements real-time commits of Drupal
entities with the Apache Solr Search Integration project. 
Implementing real-time commits to Solr not only allows
for more up to date search results, but also opens the
possibilities for other displays, reports and analysis 
previously not considered.

Installation
====================
Download the module from Drupal.org and enable the module.
After enabling the module you can view the real-time commits
from admin/reports/apachesolr_realtime_reports.
