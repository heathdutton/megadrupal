Localize Fields 7.x-1.3


Main issues
-----------
Lots of bug fixes, and far simpler and more future-proof algo.
Better compatibility with the Token module, and with custom entity and field
types.
Security - previously didn't check/escape translations.


New features
------------
- Better performance; form_alter eradicated completely.
- The field_widget_form_alter now receives $context by reference, and updates
  label and description to secure that they are translated when other module's
  ditto hook implementations start their work (also fixes Token issue #2454381).
  This new behaviour may be turned off on settings page (or set conf. var
  localize_fields_tentative) - but then Token compatibility will suffer.
- The drush script now allows for removing empty translations from database even
  in contextual mode.
- Test node type; a Features module.

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed translation of validation errors of fields attached directly to a node
  (rather: not a field_collection).
- Field view now translates multi-value'd field collection's description.
- Fixed that single row file/image description translation wasn't contextual.
- Field view now attempts to get entity type and bundle from context before
  output; fixes issue #2377555.

Security
--------
- Check/escape translated strings when setting them directy on $element props.

Update notes
------------
- Clear cache.
