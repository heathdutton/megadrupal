Localize Fields 7.x-1.4


Main issues
-----------
Maintenance update. No change what-so-ever to this module's main utility
(translating field labels etc.).
Only: more convenience in the drush department, improved help pages, and
bugfixes for the test module.

New features
------------
- The drush localize-fields script now also supports relative path argument when
  the command is executed in a dir _below_ document root.
- Improved help sections.

Bug fixes
---------
- The test Features module now installs and uses taxonomy vocabulary 'lclzflds'
  instead of 'tags', to prevent collision with any pre-existing vocabulary.
- The test Features module no longer depends on, nor configures, languages,
  because that spells conflicts. Instead the languages en and da get installed
  or enabled (if missing|disabled) programmatically when the test module gets
  enabled (issue #2511174).

Security
--------
None.

Update notes
------------
- Clear cache.
- If the localize_fields_test is enabled: disable and re-enable it, and then
  features revert it.
