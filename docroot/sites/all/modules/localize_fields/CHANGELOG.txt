localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-06-28
-----------------------------------
- Release 7.x-1.4.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-06-27
-----------------------------------
- The test Features module no longer depends on, nor configures, languages,
  because that spells conflicts. Instead the languages en and da get installed
  or enabled (if missing|disabled) programmatically when the test module gets
  enabled (issue #2511174).
- Removed non-contextual translations from the test module's .po file.
- Improved help sections.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-06-20
-----------------------------------
- The drush localize-fields script now also supports relative path argument when
  the command is executed in a dir _below_ document root.
- The test module now installs and uses taxonomy vocabulary 'lclzflds' instead
  of 'tags', to prevent collision with any pre-existing vocabulary.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-04-02
-----------------------------------
- Field view now translates multi-value'd field collection's description.
- Field view now attempts to get entity type and bundle from context before
  output; fixes issue #2377555.
- Test module now doesn't use tokens in descriptions of multi-value'd fields,
  because that will hardly work in combination with future token module version.
- Release 7.x-1.3.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-04-01
-----------------------------------
- form_alter finally gone; the preprocess_field_multiple_value_form now gets
  entity type and bundle (for troublesome field collections) from a couple of
  static vars set by the widget alter.
- The drush script now allows for removing empty translations from database even
  in contextual mode.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-03-31
-----------------------------------
- The form_alter finally reduced to only handle field_collection and unknown
  field type, having cardinality != 1.
- The field_widget_form_alter now receives $context by reference, and updates
  label and description to secure that they are translated when other module's
  ditto hook implementations start their work (also fixes Token issue #2454381).
- Fixed translation of validation errors of fields attached directly to a node
  (rather: not a field_collection). The hook_field_attach_validate()
  implementation failed to establish bundle name correctly.
- Check/escape translated strings when setting them directy on $element props.
- Moved the UI module out of module folder.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-03-30
-----------------------------------
- Test node type; a Features module.
- Added dedicated support for image type; simply a subset of file.
- Fixed that single row file/image description translation wasn't contextual.
- Added support for taxonomy_term_reference; like text field.
- Fixed translation of label of boolean list on-value as label.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-03-29
-----------------------------------
- Fixed issue #2423065 some more.
- Moved hook_preprocess_field_multiple_value_form() implementation to make the
  sequence of invocations visually apparant.
- Don't make type-safe (!== '') evaluations of labels and descriptions;
  core doesn't do that, and '0' should probably not be translated anyway.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-03-10
-----------------------------------
- Fixed that translation didn't work for multiple value'd field instances
  attached directly to a node; not nested in field collection (issue #2423065).
- Release 7.x-1.2.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2015-01-22
-----------------------------------
* Release 7.x-1.1.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-12-14
-----------------------------------
* UI shan't support 'allowed_values' translation for any other list types than the simple core list types (list_boolean, list_text, list_integer, list_decimal, list_float) (issue #2378337).
* Use global language, not user language (issue #2384655).

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-11-19
-----------------------------------
* Abort field view translation if non-standard field type which misses the #bundle bucket (issue #2377555).

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-06-09
-----------------------------------
* Prepared for release.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-29
-----------------------------------
* Fixed that exception thrown in batch callback wasn't being traced (inspect).
* Fixed field args for insert in batch callback was utterly wrong.
* Added batch results 'failed' flag, to be able to tell the batch finished function if there was an error (other than the PHP errors that batch API listens to).
* Log batch translation copying to watchdog.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-26
-----------------------------------
* t() options cannot be a variable ;-).
* Translation of _NOT_TRANSLATED_ must have dedicated context.
* Removed drush script's alias; wasn't renamed, and we don't want collisions anyway.

localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-25
-----------------------------------
* Renamed the module, to localize_fields from features_localize_fields.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-25
--------------------------------------------
* Copy translations from/to i18n_field.
* Removed copyright notice.
* Clear translation cache of all languages upon copying.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-24
--------------------------------------------
* Make i18n_field's module weight less than ours, because things break if i18n_field translates after we do.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-23
--------------------------------------------
* Sometimes single row instances have the same structure as any/multiple row instance. Thus the instance wrapper MUST be translated (disregarding cardinality).
* Added context() method, and removed ..._translate function.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-14
--------------------------------------------
* Enable this modules' UI sub module if this module and the field_ui module are enabled (unless variable 'features_localize_fields_noautoenableui' set).

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-13
--------------------------------------------
* Locale cache clearing, to prevent outdate 'ghost' translations.
* Logging/message display now configurable (defaults to log, no display).
* Fixed naming (..._ui) in the _ui module.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-12
--------------------------------------------
* Module weight -100.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-11
--------------------------------------------
* UI done.
* UI sub module'd.
* Context setting now defaults to 'context + non-context fallback', because that makes the transition within an existing site painless; and otherwise few people will ever stumble upon and experience the benefits of using context.
* Module weight -1: get the field_widget_form_alter and form_alter invoked before other form_alters.
* Warn about i18n_field incompatibility.
* Added (commented out) skeleton implementations of hook_field_attach_rename_bundle(), hook_field_attach_delete_bundle(), hook_field_delete().

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-04
--------------------------------------------
* Now uses internationalization context for the module's own translatable labels and messages.
* Implemented UI field instance translation.
* Fixed allowed_values_no_localization UI.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-05-02
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed double slash path bug in the drush script.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-30
--------------------------------------------
* Clear fields' data memorized for the form_alter upon (first) use.
* Updated develop by feature/translation-gui to get coding standards changes applied.
* Fixed that UI translation fields shan't get saved to database field_config/field_config_instance.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-28
--------------------------------------------
* Context/non-context values reversed and now defined as class constants.
* Renamed methods to camelCased to conform with coding standards; despite underscored names for proxied hooked implementations are more easily identified as such.
* Removed underscore prefix from protected class attributes.
* Created UI class.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-26
--------------------------------------------
* Translate list type fields' options settings too.
* Added public translate method+function.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-20
--------------------------------------------
* Don't translate list options in view, if field setting 'allowed_values_no_localization'.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-18
--------------------------------------------
* Doesn't depend on Features; there are two config menu items (effectively leading to the same page), one requiring a Locale permission and another requiring a Features permission.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-17
--------------------------------------------
* Changed context delimiter pattern to field_instance:[bundle]-[field namd]:[label name], from field_instance-[bundle]-[field namd]-[label name].
* Fixed context pattern error in the view method.
* Much better conversion to-from context. No context: optional --removeempty option which removes possible overshadowing empty translations.
  Use context: don't clone empty translations, and _prefer_ cloning from a non-context translation (don't require it).

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-16
--------------------------------------------
* Less options for drush script.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-15
--------------------------------------------
* The drush script now works in database too; fixing context when not in 'use context' mode, and a adding sources and targets when in 'use context' mode.
* Implemented 'allowed_values_no_localization' setting for list fields, usable when in it isn't desirable to get long select option lists translated.
* Don't use textgroup (Oops), and don't update location when no context mode and clearing context in db sources.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-14
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed typo in scripts that establishes quote encoding.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-13
--------------------------------------------
* All fields having #element_validate must be pre validated, not only date.
* Translation context/no-context/fallback done.
* Now reuses translations as much as possible.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-09
--------------------------------------------
* Release 7.x-1.1.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-08
--------------------------------------------
* Allow 1000 options in lists.
* Doesn't depend on the Features module.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-07
--------------------------------------------
* Translate #title in element root too, when element has value.#title.
* Removed UTF-8 arg for get_html_translation_table() because that third parameter triggers warning in PHP<5.3.4 (and character set doesn't matter for our use).
* Fixed encoding error; get_html_translation_table() cannot be trusted for old PHP versions and using check_plain() is less error prone anyway.
* Markup cannot be encoded.
* Removed fix for dysfunctional translation of date_select errors (via Javascript), because not needed with Date 7.x-2.7+.
* Fixed translation of error messages created by hook_field_validate() implmentations (like the Number field module).

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-06
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed that labels may be encoded (single and double quotes only) and thus don't correspond to translation sources.
* Released 7.x-1.1-date-7.x-2.6.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-05
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed Date translation. NB: not tested with Date 7.x-2.7.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-04
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed translation of multiple/any cardinality file instances (because the labels on instances are used by core field validation).

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-04-01
--------------------------------------------
* Release 7.x-1.0.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-03-30
--------------------------------------------
* Translate field view.

features_localize_fields 7.x-1.x, 2014-03-29
--------------------------------------------
* Project started.
