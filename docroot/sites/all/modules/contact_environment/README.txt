This module adds a footer to the bottom of emails generated by Drupal's Contact 
module. The footer provides additional information about the contact form 
submission: user agent, IP address, and HTTP referrer. These details may be 
helpful in providing additional context for contact form submissions describing 
problems or asking questions about site content.

We are currently running this module in production on Drupal 7.x. We are also 
using the Contact Forms module, but this module does not depend on it.
