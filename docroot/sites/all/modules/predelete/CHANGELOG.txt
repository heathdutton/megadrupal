predelete 7.x-1.0
----------------
- Initial working Module

predelete 7.x-1.1
----------------
- Changed the API for hook_predelete_node(). It now takes the whole node object
  and not just the node id. This is better and quicker if more than one module
  implements the hook.
- Fixed API documentation
- Added theme function for displaying more than one reason
- Added this CHANGELOG.txt :)
- Added some information in the README.txt
- Fixed some typo in the module (the menu callback e.g.)
