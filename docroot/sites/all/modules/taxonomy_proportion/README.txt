DESCRIPTION
-----------

2 widgets are available : autocomplete (with term creation) and radio/checkboxes
field prefix (like â‚¬ or $) or suffix (like %) can be used

a formatter that allows you to display the term after or before the proportion.

use cases:
recipes: list of the ingredients with their proportion.
products: composition of the material like grape varieties in wine, metals in jewellery, ...
people: weight their strengths and weakness
