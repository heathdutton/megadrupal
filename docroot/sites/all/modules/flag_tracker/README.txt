The Flag Tracker module makes it easy for users to track arbitrary
nodes just like the issue following functionality on drupal.org. 
It uses the core tracker module to store the nodes that users have 
tracked, and the the flag module to allow users to select nodes to
track. 

Installation
------------

1) Copy the flag directory to the modules folder in your installation.

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Modules (/admin/modules)

Configuration
-------------
Visit the node configuration page to set up tracking. For each node
you can select which flag to use for tracking, and if you want to show
the number of followers.
