======================================================
INSTALLATION
======================================================
1. Unpack the akamai folder and contents in the appropriate modules directory 
   of your Drupal installation.  Normally sites/all/modules/
   
2. Enable the akamai module on the Modules admin page (admin/build/modules)

3. You will also need a license to use Akamai's network, http://www.akamai.com/index.html.

======================================================
USAGE
======================================================
The module allows two forms of interaction for clearing the cache.
1. Block form :
  Enable this on the admin/build/block section of the admin UI and 
  put the block where you want.  This form will clear the path that is 
  listed above the button, (likely the page you are currently viewing).
  
2. Refresh Tool tab:
  The Refresh Tool tab is found at, admin/settings/akamai/refresh.  It is 
  part of the admin interface for this module.  From here you can list
  several paths to be cleared.

The Akamai module also offers integration with Context through the context_http_header module.

======================================================
HOOKS
======================================================
Occasionally when one path is cleared, others will need to be cleared 
as well. To enable this, we have an alter hook you can implement.

function HOOK_akamai_paths_alter(&$paths, $node)

 * $paths An array of URL paths to be submitted to Akamai for clearing, this
          array can be modified.
 * $node If this is a node page you are viewing, this will be that node, otherwise
         it will be NULL.

===================================================
Rest API changes
===================================================

To enable and use RestAPI instead of SOAP, make sure RestAPI checkbox option is checked and Akamai
server url is configured. If RestAPI is unchecked, SOAP will be used instead.

Make sure PHP Curl libraries installed and enabled.
