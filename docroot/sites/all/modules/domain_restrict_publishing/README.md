Domain Restrict Publishing
==========================

## Summary

Domain Restrict Publishing is a helper module building on top of the excellent
[Domain Access](https://www.drupal.org/project/domain) module.

The module enables site administrators to restrict the domains a user can
publish to, based on their assigned domains.

The module was designed to work with the "Set domain access status for all content"
and allows content to be promoted to other domains while keeping control over
which domain editors can edit it.


## Installation
