A Drupal 7 module that provides views integration for the Google Analytics Data Export API.

This allows you to use Google Analytics directly through views to do things like Most Popular, Most Read ect.  
You can combine the statistics to create interesting results.

After you install the module - go to /admin/config/ga_stats to configure your Google Analytics account information and begin pulling statistics.
