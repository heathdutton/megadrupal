The Isotope Module is a Drupal 7 Javascript Implementation of
David DeSandro's Isotope.js

Isotope.js provides a mosaic style that uses CSS transistions and
transformations but also falls back to Javascript for browsers
that do not support CSS animations.  It also provides the option
to add the aditional javascript files jQuery bbq, infinitescroll,
and the most up to date jQuery
