-- MODULE INSTALLATION

* Download Contextly module and unpack it to the modules folder (usually
  "sites/all/modules").
* Donwload supported version of the Integration Kit and unpack it to the
  "sites/all/libraries/contextly-kit" folder. See online documentation for a
  download link: https://www.drupal.org/node/2093671
* Enable Contextly module.
* Follow instructions from appeared status message. If you've missed it for some
  reason, go to "Configuration -> Content authoring -> Contextly" and follow
  instructions to get an API key.
* Go to "Configuration -> Content authoring -> Text formats" and enable
  "Contextly sidebars" filter on each text format you use for nodes. This filter
  converts special HTML comment into an empty tag (<span> by default) with the
  "class" attribute. The order of filters is important. We recommend to put the
  "Contextly sidebars" filter before the "Limit allowed HTML tags" filter
  (if any) and add sidebar tag name to the list of allowed.
* Grant permission "Manage Contextly links and sidebars" to content editors.
