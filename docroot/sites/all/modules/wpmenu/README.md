# WordPress Menu
## What is WordPress Menu
This is a Drupal module for replacing existing toolbar / admin_toolbar menu modules with a much more styled and usable interface, which WordPress uses. This module contains initial navigation links, as well as utlizes standard Drupal hooks to preprocess the data to anything you need.

## Installation Instructions
Currently the modules is not hosted on Drupal.org as we need to determine the best way to serve the 3rd Party code while adhering to Drupal's best practices / standards for not including them directly in the module. (feedback or recommendations are greatly appreciated). For now simply clone or download this project in to your /modules/contrib directory, we assume it will be a full contrib module before Drupal 8 hits full release.

As mentioned above, we welcome feedback or ideas even requests to backport this to Drupal 7.
