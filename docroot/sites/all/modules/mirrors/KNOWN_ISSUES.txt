** NODE export / import **
* Language property is exported in longformat ("English"), but imported as token
("EN").
--> might be solved with "raw output" Views patch.
* Multiple terms are exported with a comma (",") as separator, but importer
needs Feeds Tamper plugin to explode on separator.
--> solved with feeds_tamper, but no hook / method to call.

** TAXONOMY export / import **
* Property "tid" not supported by feeds. Using "name" as unique identifier.

** USER export / import **
* Roles not supported by feeds. solution might be a 'role' target in feeds or
'role = bundle'. Custom logic required.
* Passwords not support by views.
