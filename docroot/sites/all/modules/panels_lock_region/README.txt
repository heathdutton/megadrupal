INTRODUCTION
------------

Panels Lock Region is a Panels display renderer plugin which adds full region
lock functionality to Panels In-Place Editor. It allows users with certain
permission to lock/unlock entire regions on a Panel, so other users that can
use Panels IPE are able to edit panes arrangement, but only for those regions
that are not locked.
