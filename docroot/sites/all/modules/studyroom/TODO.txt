Sub-modules:
  - studyroom_user
    - ban users (include semester option)
  - studyroom_report
    - Reports on usage (and many variations)
    - Maybe use Google graphs (I think there is a module) or something like that
    - If used, do we create records of deleted reservations?
      (new table and a few hooks)
    - studyroom_notify
      - Cron stuff here??
      - add phone number/provider field to users
    - studyroom_issues
      - Reporting/ticketing mini-system
    - studyroom_semesters
      - Create way to define semesters and limit system

We might also have to look at creating a install profile to get everything
installed correctly on a new Drupal website.

Other items for consideration:
- Caching (performance)
- Ajax/JQuery
- http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
- Colorbox (reservations form)
- Wysiwyg
- Mobile (Iâ€™ve seen a few where the interface is completely different in mobile.
  Ex the search only return one space, not all due to screen width)
- Users->preferred location
- Drupal tests
- Documentation/usage (instruction, usage videos)
