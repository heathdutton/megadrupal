Feature: Once rooms_availability_reference is installed
  In order to create bookable units
  As a site administrator
  I should be able to add Availability calendars in any entity.

@api @javascript
Scenario: Admin user should be able to add an availability_calendar in nodes.
  Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role

  # Creating a unit type and some units.
  Given unit types:
    | type     | label    | base_price | min_sleeps | max_sleeps | min_children | max_children |
    | standard | Standard | 100        | 2          | 3          | 0            | 1            |

  # Creating a bunch of units programmatically.
  Given "standard" units:
    | name       | base_price |
    | Normal     | 120        |
    | Special    | 130        |

  # Creating a customer profile.
  Given customer profiles:
    | profile_id | name        | country | locality | address       | postal_code |
    | profile1   | User test 1 | US      | Austin   | 1900 David St | 78705       |
    | profile2   | User test 2 | US      | Austin   | 1900 David St | 78705       |

  # Creating a booking.
  Given "standard_booking" bookings:
    | profile_id | guests | children | start_date | end_date   | unit   | status |
    | profile2   | 1      | 1        | 2016-05-19 | 2016-05-23 | Normal | 1      |

  Then the "Normal" unit should be Confirmed by the last booking between "2016-05-19" and "2016-05-22"

  # Creating a booking.
  Given "standard_booking" bookings:
    | profile_id | guests | children | start_date | end_date   | unit    | status |
    | profile1   | 3      | 0        | 2016-05-19 | 2016-05-23 | Special | 0      |

  Then the "Special" unit should be Unconfirmed by the last booking between "2016-05-19" and "2016-05-22"

  When I add the "availability_ref" availability reference field referencing to "standard" units in "page2" content
  Then I should be able to edit a "page2"
  And reference units "Normal,Special" in the "availability_ref" field
  And I fill in "title" with "asdf"
  And I press the "Save" button

  Then I navigate in the fullCalendar to "2016-05"
  And I should see the text "User test 2"
  And I should see the text "UNCONF"
