Representative Image allows you to define a field for each entity bundle that
should be referenced to display an image when a representative image for an
entity is requested.

== EXAMPLE 1 ==
Imagine you want to setup opengraph metadata to display an image with your
content, but different content types have different image fields. With this you
can set all your content types to simply use the representative image field.

== EXAMPLE 2 ==
If you want to create an administrative view of all your content similar
to the table found at /admin/content you can easily show thumbnail with your
content by including the representative image field in views.
