 * Factory class for creating Module Builder task handlers.

 *
 * The process for using this factory is:
 *  - Get the factory from module_builder_get_factory(), passing the name of the
 *    environment class that represents where you are using Module Builder.
 *  - Get the task handler. This checks the environment to see whether it is
 *    suitably set up for the requested task (eg, whether the hooks directory
 *    exists, whether hook data has been compiled). This throws an exception if
 *    the environment is not in a state the task requires.
 *  - Execute the required method on the task handler.
