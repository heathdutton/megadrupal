/**
 * Abstract base Generator for components.
 *
 * (This named to distinguish it from the Base Task clas.)
 *
 * The generator process works over three phases:
 *  - a tree of generators is gathered
 *  - a list of file info is built up, with each generator allowed to contribute
 *  - the file info is processed and returned for the caller to output
 *
 * @section sec_gather_generators Gathering generators
 * The generator system starts with a particular generator for a
 * given component (e.g., 'module'), and then adding generators this one
 * requests, recursing this process into each new generator and building a tree
 * down from the original one. This is done by assembleComponentList(), which is
 * recursively called on each generator class. Each class implements
 * requiredComponents() to return a list of child components. The process ends
 * when the added generators are themselves one that return no sub-components.
 *
 * So for example, the caller requests a 'module' component. This causes the
 * entry point to the system, ModuleBuider\Task\Generate::generateComponent(),
 * to instantiate a module generator, which is then interrogated for its
 * subcomponents. It returns, say, that it needs:
 *  - a README file
 *  - a .info file
 *  - hooks, which is an abstract component which represents the module's code
 *    which we are to generate.
 * The first two components are terminal: they do not have subcomponents of
 * their own. The hooks component however adds more generators: a code file
 * generator for each file it needs for the hooks it has been requested to
 * generate. The code files are then interrogated, and return no subcomponents:
 * the gathering process is thus complete.
 *
 * The end result is a flat list of components, keyed by component names. Each
 * component has the data it needs to operate.
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_tree Assemble component tree
 * The list of components is iterated over in assembleComponentTree() to
 * assemble a tree structure of the components, where child components are those
 * that are contained by their parents. For example, the module code file
 * contains functions and hook implementations.
 *
 * This tree is iterated over again in assembleContainedComponents() to allow
 * the parent components in the tree to gather data from their child components.
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_file_info Collect file info
 * We then recurse down the tree in collectFiles(), building up
 * an array of file info that we pass by reference (this it can be altered
 * as well as added to, though generator order is TBFO). Generator classes that
 * wish to add files should override collectFiles() to add them.
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_files Assemble files
 * Finally, we assemble the file info into filenames and code, ready for the
 * initiator of the whole process (e.g., Drush, Drupal UI) to output them in an
 * appropriate way. This is done in the starting generator's assembleFiles().
 *
 * There are three distinct hierarchies at work here:
 *  - A plain PHP class hierarchy, which is just there to allow us to make use
 *    of method inheritance. So for instance, ModuleCodeFile inherits from File.
 *    This is just for code re-use.
 *  - A hierarchy formed by components that request other components in turn.
 *    This fans out from the initially requested root component, e.g. 'module'.
 *    This is based on how things fit together conceptually: a module may need
 *    hooks, and a hook implementation needs a file it can go in. The same
 *    component may appear at different parts of the request hierarchy.
 *  - The tree of components that is assembled prior to building code. This is
 *    purely to do with containment. Thus, a code file contains its functions.
 *    This comes into play when a component is building its code, and may
 *    interrogate its child components in this hierarchy to have them add to
 *    what it provides.
 *
 * Rough conceptual hierarchy:
  - component generators/file generators (NOT class hierarchy: processing chain!)
   - module
     - codeModule ---> hooks & callbacks
       - codeModuleFile
     - info
     - readme
     - tests
   - theme
     - codeTheme ---> theme functions
     - codeThemeFile
     - info
     - readme
   - profile
     - codeProfile --> hooks
     - info
     - readme
   - plugin ??
     - goes beneath module somehow??????

   the initial request causes:
     - figuring out which generator to start up
     - component generator figures out:
       - subcomponents (hooks, info file, plugins, tests)
       - each subcomponent recurses and eventually gets to a file generator.
