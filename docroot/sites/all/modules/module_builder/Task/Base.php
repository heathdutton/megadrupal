/**
 * Base class for Tasks.
 *
 * Task classes contain code to perform distinct operations. For example,
 * getting hook data by finding and processing api.php files is the domain of
 * the Collect task.
 *
 * Each task may also define the sanity level it requires. This allows the
 * Environment object to state whether the current environment is ready for the
 * task. For example, generating a module requires hook data to be ready;
 * whereas processing hook data does not.
 *
 * Task classes may be specialized for different major versions of Drupal, by
 * appending the version number to the class name. The unversioned class should
 * also exist as a parent class.
 *
 * Task objects are instantiated by ModuleBuilderFactory::getTask().
