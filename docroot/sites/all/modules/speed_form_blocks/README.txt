SPEED FORM BLOCKS
=================

Speed form blocks is a single module (enabled via the modules page) which :

Allows a site user to create a simple form (using some of the drupal Form API)
 consisting of multiple form elements.
 
Each form is then stored in drupal's database, and once created, can be 
deployed as a block.

Going to the structure | Blocks page will show you the speed form blocks you
 have created and allow you to choose where they appear on the site.
 
Each block stores feedback in the database, and feedback can be viewed
 via the admin panel, and extracted as CSV.

Once the module is enabled please go to structure | Speed form blocks

Remember feedback is stored in the database, so on sites with high database
 load this may lead to the table becoming big. Speed form blocks allows for
 the feedback to be taken out as CSV and so used in say Excel or Open Office
 for longer term storage.

The module doesn't have any hooks. Please let me know if you'd find one 
useful. Always happy to take on board ideas for improvements (when time 
permits).

The module is not known to cause any conflicts and doesn't require any other 
modules.
