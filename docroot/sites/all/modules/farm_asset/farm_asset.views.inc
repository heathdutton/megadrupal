   * terms, with a count of the number of assets that are in them.
   *
   * For example: the list of Animal Groups in Farm Livestock, or the list of
   * Crops in Farm Plantings.
   *
   * The reason we override is so that we can add a little extra logic to the
   * join so that only "active" assets are included. This is provided as an
   * option in the relationship handler, so it can be added only when necessary.
