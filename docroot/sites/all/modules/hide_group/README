hide_group

Description :
The hide group module is used if you want to simplify the node forms by hiding fieldset, either by just not displaying them (display:none) or striping them from the form generation
Pretty usefull if you want to hide fieldset and keep the form element values

Installation instructions :
1. Download and uncompressed the archive into your site modules directory
2. Install the module (package User interface)

Usage :
There are 3 ways to hide a group :
--- Declare it on the hide_group settings form (one line for each group you want to hide)
--- Declare it on a hook_hide_group_declare
--- Set the format type to Hide group on fieldset settings in your content type field (you got 2 possible fieldgroup setting : hidden or striped, the default is hidden)

Advice :
Since the module is altering form, it need to be executed at last one
His weight is set to 1000 (which should be higher enough) during the install but you might have to change it on your database (system table) if any other module defining fieldset on form have greater weight
