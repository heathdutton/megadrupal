Profile2 Moderation

A "quite hackish procedure"â„¢ to enable moderation on user profiles but it works :).

Requirements:
- Profile2
- Profile revisions patch: https://drupal.org/files/profile2-revisions-1043128-55.patch
  More information on: https://drupal.org/node/1043128

Installation:
- Just install like a regular module.

Usage:
- On profile type form enable/disable moderation.
- Go to admin/profile/moderate to list all profile revisions to be moderated.
- Only users with moderate profile permission can moderate (by default on admin role).
