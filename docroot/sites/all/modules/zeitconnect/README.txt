ZeitSchedule

This widget enables your MINDBODY class schedule to be seamlessly
integrated into your website. It is also the widget upon which your custom
iPhone app is based. It is highly customizable, available in a calendar or
list view, and customers can browse using filters or date ranges.
Additionally, because all this happens on your site, it allows your tracking
software to capture user movements inside the schedule, giving you the
ability to better tailor your offerings to your customers’ desires.

Highly customizable
Available as part of a custom iPhone schedule app
The upshot?

Envision a customer hoping to attend one of your classes at the end of a
hectic day. But does her favorite instructor teach at 6:00 or 6:30? Her
memory is no obstacle, as she checks your site or your iPhone app and sees
that the class begins at 6:30 – plenty of time. No friction for her, no
lost business—and no hassle—for you.

ZeitProspects

Make potential customers’ first interaction with you more pleasant and
productive, by simplifying the “Contact Us” aspect of your existing site.
This widget does this by creating an integrated form that delivers new
customer information directly to your MINDBODY account.

Potential customers are guided by the form to enter their name, contact
information, and any other information you’d like to ask for, such as
interests relevant to your offerings or how they found out about your
business.

Make money with ZeitProspects
No more transferring data on prospective customers by hand, and more
ability to find out who your potential customers are and how you can
answer their questions. Easier, more efficient, and a better first
impression on a customer’s first interaction with your business.


ZeitEnrollment

Beyond the schedule and the menu of offerings, are the special workshops,
events and series that need a place of their own. This widget seamlessly
displays these harder-to-classify elements easily and separately,
using data from your MINDBODY account.

This is especially important for the interested but reluctant customer.
She wants to try out your classes, but feels intimidated. On your site,
though, she sees an upcoming beginners’ series, and her anxiety lessens.
Classes just for her, and she can sign up immediately through the
“Enroll” button.


Customizable, including Enroll buttons
Choose two layouts: Brief or Comprehensive
It also satisfies a more experienced customer, who can easily find special
workshops or events that meet his needs for deepening his practice. Having
this section updated and prominent will enable your business to be the place
he checks first to find these offerings.
