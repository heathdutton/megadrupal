Multi Node Add
--------------

This module provides a new interface for creating nodes
where the users are able to select the fields what they
want to use for creating the nodes and it is designed to
create multiple nodes in one round.
This module heavily depends on Javascript. Tested on recent
versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Konqueror and Opera.

Usage
-----
As an alternative of node/add/_nodetype_ , after the module is enabled,
navigate to multi_node_add/_nodetype_, for example to
multi_node_add/story and you can select the fields then
create the nodes.
The module uses the normal node permissions, so if you want to allow
the usage of this module to a role, allow 'create story content' or
instead of the story, with the desired content-type.

With the "Prepopulate based on first form" button, after the iFrames are loaded,
it is possible to speed up entering the data, the common values can be copied
from the first form.
