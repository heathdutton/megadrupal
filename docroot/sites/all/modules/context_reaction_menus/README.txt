Context Reaction Menus for Context 3.x for Drupal 7.x
---------------------------------------------------------
Context Reaction Menus provides a reaction for Context that switches the
"main menu" and "secondary menu" (as read in page.tpl.php as $main_menu, or
hook_preprocess_page() / hook_process_page() as $variables['main_menu']). If
you are already familiar with the Context module and its conditions and
reactions then this module should be very straightforward!

Installation
------------
1. Context Reaction Menus can be installed like any other Drupal module - place
it in the modules directory for your site and enable it.

2. You must clear all caches (the button on the admin/settings/performance
screen is one way to do it) in order to see the new reaction that is provided
by this module.
