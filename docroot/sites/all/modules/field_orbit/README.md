Field Orbit
===========

This module provides a slideshow display for image fields and
field collections using the [orbit](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/orbit.php)
plugin.

It is largely copied from the [Field Slideshow](http://drupal.org/project/field_slideshow)
module and would be better to eventually refactor that module to
be able to support other slideshow libraries.
