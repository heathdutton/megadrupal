INSTALLATION
============

1) Install behat on your machine following these instructions:
   http://docs.behat.org/quick_intro.html#installation
   
2) Copy file "behat.yml" and directory "features" to 
   site root directory.
   
3) Customize the path to "behat/bootstrap" in behat.yml
   if the behat module isn't located at "sites/all/modules/behat"
   
4) Set $base_url in settings.php if your site is not 
   accessible at http://localhost/ 
   (otherwise drupalPost() won't work)
   
5) Test if behat is set up correctly and switch to the shell, 
   change to the Drupal root directory and run:
   
   $ behat
   
   This should execute the example feature.
