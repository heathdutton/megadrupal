Git Status
==========
Do you use git in your web server? This very simple module allows you to access some information of your git repository, using the Drupal interface.

If you don't use git to develop or deploy your Drupal project, you don't need to install this module.

Instructions
------------
Just install the module and go to the Status report page (/admin/reports/status).

Requirements
------------
The web server must be allowed to execute *git* commands. Probably this should work by default.
