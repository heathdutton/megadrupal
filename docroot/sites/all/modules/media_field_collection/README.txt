Name: Media Field Collection Module 
Author: Robert Castelo
Sponsor: Code Positive [www.codepositive.com]

DESCRIPTION:

    Small tweaks to better integrate the Media and Field Collection modules:
    
    Usage Listing
    On the file usage page convert each listings of a Field Collection usage into a listing that 
    displays the field collection's parent entity, for example field-collection/field-fc-example/6 
    is converted to the alias for node/3 which the page the field collection is displayed on.
