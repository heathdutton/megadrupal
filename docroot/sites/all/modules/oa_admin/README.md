OPTIONAL but Recommended. Provides the replacement for the Drupal Content page.

Similar to the view provided by Panopoly Admin, this view adds filters for OA
Space and Section.  Available at admin/content or Admin -> Content page.  This
is a Feature module that simply exports the Open Atrium Content Admin
(oa_admin_views_node) view.
