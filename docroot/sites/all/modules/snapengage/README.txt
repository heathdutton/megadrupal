The SnapEngage module lets you add the SnapEngage widget to your site.

SnapEngage is a simple and streamlined live chat service. Engage with
your visitors and improve your conversion, turning your website
visitors into customers. Live chat with your visitors from your
favorite instant messenger or mobile device and easily integrate with
your existing CRM or Helpdesk solution.

The code is heavily inspired by the Google Analytics module.

# Installation

Create an account at www.snapengage.com, install the module and go to
"Administration > Configuration > System > SnapEngage" where you can
enter your widget ID. The widget will now appear on your pages.

# Further configuration

At "Administration > Configuration > System > SnapEngage" it is
possible to restrict display of the widget to only specific roles
and/or on specific pages.

You can delegate administration of the above settings to a role of
your choice by setting the "Administer SnapEngage" permission.
