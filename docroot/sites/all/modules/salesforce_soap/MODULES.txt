SALESFORCE SUITE MODULES:
-------------------------

  Salesforce API (salesforce_api):
    Core Suite module including implementations of Salesforce API and various wrappers. 
    Provides an admin screen for managing API connection settings, CRUD for fieldmappings, 
    CRUD for mapped objects, and integration with CTools, Features, Views, and Drush. 
    This is a prerequisite for all other Suite modules.

  Salesforce Entity (sf_entity):
    Handles both exports and imports of core and contributed Drupal entities, including both
    core fields and FieldAPI fields.

  Salesforce Import (sf_import):
    Implements bulk fieldmap-based import functionality for one-off imports of Salesforce data. 
    Particularly useful for bootstrapping Drupal-Salesforce integrations by pulling in a large
    batch of data initially.

  Salesforce Notifications (sf_notifications)
    Provides functionality to respond to Salesforce Outbound Notifications.
    Can be used to trigger imports in Drupal when data changes in Salesforce.

  Salesforce Match (sf_prematch):
    Defines an API to allow object mapping modules to define "matching" criteria against which 
    to search for and update existing objects before creating new ones.
    Primarly useful in reducing duplicate object creation.

  Salesforce Queue (sf_queue):
    Implements a queueing system for outbound object data. Primarly useful in reducing 
    Salesforce API usage.
