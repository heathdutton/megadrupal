# Flocknote Module

The Flocknote module for Drupal enables Drupal websites to interact with
Flocknote Networks. The module currently has the following features:

  1. Connecting your website to Flocknote (authentication).
  2. Automatically subscribing new Flocknote users to a Flocknote List.

The module will be expanded to include more functionality over time, so be sure
to keep it up to date!

# Installation

Install the module as you would any other Drupal module, and after it's enabled,
visit the 'API Authentication' page to enter your Flocknote authentication info.

You will need a Flocknote Application ID and Key in addition to your Flocknote
user account. The App ID and Key enable access to the Flocknote API.

You can apply for an App ID and Key on Flocknote's API documentation site:
http://www.flocknote.com/help/api

Enter the authentication information, then click 'Save app and login info'.

You are now ready to configure the Flocknote module's settings (in the
Configuration > Web Services area of your site's administration area).
