1. Install Moodle in the same database as Drupal, on the same domain. (e.g., "/moodle")
-- Place the moodle folder at the root of your drupal site
-- Go to "/moodle/admin" to begin the moodle database installation

2. Edit the admin's profile in Moodle and set the moodle admin user's "idnumber" to 1

3. Copy the Drupal authentication plugin to Moodle:
-- cp -r <drupaldir>/sites/default/modules/course_moodle/copy_to_moodle/auth/drupal <moodledir>/auth
-- In Moodle go to: "/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=manageauths" and enable the Drupal plugin by clicking on the closed eye icon

4. Enable web service protocols in moodle
-- Go to "/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=optionalsubsystems" and find "Enable web services" and be sure it is checked. Save changes.
-- Go to "/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=webserviceprotocols"
-- Enable SOAP by clicking on the closed eye icons

5. Create and configure a new web service
-- Go to "/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=externalservices" and click "Add"
-- Give the service a name (possibly "drupal") and check the "Enabled" box
-- The next screen should allow you to "Add functions"
-- Select all the functions that are not marked DEPRECATED and save

6. Create a token for the web service
-- Go to "/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=webservicetokens" and click "Add"
-- Select the moodle admin user and the new service
-- Save
-- Keep this page open, you will need the generated token in the next step

7. Configure the course moodle module (drupal side)
-- go to: "/admin/settings/course/moodle"
-- add the prefix, path and token (copy and paste from the moodle screen in the previous step)
-- Save
