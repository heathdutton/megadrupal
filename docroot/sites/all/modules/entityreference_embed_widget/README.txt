-- SUMMARY --
This module provides an advanced Entity Reference widget. To use it, create an
entity reference field, set it to use an autocomplete (embed) widget, and in
the field instance settings select a view mode (e.g. teaser) to use. Now when
you select an entity to reference and click on "Add item" button, you should
see a preview of the referenced entity in the selected view mode. Also, this
widget provides "Remove" button against each field (Drupal does not facilitate
to remove these fields after you have added).
