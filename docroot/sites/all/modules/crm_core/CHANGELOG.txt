CRM Core 7.x-0.95 (13-Aug-2013)

The major change for this version of CRM Core deals with the name field.

The name field is now unlocked, users can do with it what they wish. Just
remember that deleting the name field will make most of the UI modules 
not work.

There is a patch for the name module (see https://drupal.org/node/2047643)
that needs to be used for CRM Core to work properly.

  requires a patch to properly support different naming conventions for 
  different contact types (https://drupal.org/node/2047643)
- Unlocked contact name to allow field permissions settings.
- Addressed an issue where users were being forced to use CRM Core 
  Contact UI (https://drupal.org/node/1897892)
