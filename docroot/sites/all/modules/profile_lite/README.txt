Similar to the Profile2 module, this module is an alternative and simplified
successor to the deprecated Profile module that ships with Drupal core. This
module differs from Profile2 in that it doesn't set up separate entities for
each category, but instead adds all the fields to the user entity. This can
greatly simplify the management of these fields.

This module requires CTools.
