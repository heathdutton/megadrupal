The basic idea behind this module is, displaying the latest flickr thumbnail 
images tiled in any block. Basically the module will read an individual 
account holders Flickr feed (http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/) and 
displays the thumbnail linked to the Flickr page. The images has been filtered 
by Flickr ID, Photo Tags or any one of these two items. 
The default images are being pulled from the Flickr public feed.

Flickr ID
=========
You need a Flickr ID to display your Flickr images. This ID is unique and you 
will get it when you register an account with www.Flickr.com. Your Flickr ID 
will look something like this 22828405@N04, if you do not find your ID, you 
can get it easily from http://idgettr.com by giving your username.

Flickr Tags
===========
Flickr Tags will search the Flickr public feed and it will display all the 
images that has been tagged with different keywords. For example, say you 
added chipmunks,baseball,winter. This module finds only photos of chipmunks, 
baseball and winter.
