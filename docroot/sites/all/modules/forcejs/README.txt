Force JS
========

Removes the "has_js" cookie for anonymous users without an open session.

When a browser renders a page generated by Drupal, a piece of JavaScript is
executed which adds a cookie ("has_js=1"). This allows Drupal to generate
different markup depending on whether the user agent is capable of executing
JavaScript or not.

This approach has been developed as a part of the Batch API (see [1]).
However, generating different markup depending on characteristics of the user
agent breaks page level caching. This is one of the reasons why the "has_js"
cookie was removed from Pressflow[2] and also from Drupal 8[3].

Note that removing the "has_js" cookie completely breaks the Batch API Ajax,
therefore the cookie is only removed for anonymous users without an open
session.

Configuration
-------------
It is possible to choose the value Drupal should internally assume for the
has_js cookie when accessed by anonymous users without an open session. The
configuration can be accessed under:

    Administration » Configuration » Development » Performance
