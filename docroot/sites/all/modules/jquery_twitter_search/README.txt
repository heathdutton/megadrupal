jQuery Twitter Search

With this module you can create as many jQuery Twitter Search blocks as you like to your website. You can give each block itâ€™s own search term. The block will then show a stream of relevant Tweets.

Each block is highly configurable in the UI and custom CSS styling.

This module requires:

  The jquery.twitter.search.js plugin.
  The twitteroauth library
  You own Twitter application
  libraries

Installation:

  Install this module.
  Install libraries.
  Download the jquery.twitter.search.js plugin. Create the folder sites/all/libraries/jquery_twitter_search and add jquery.twitter.search.js to the newly created folder
  Download the twitteroauth library and copy it to the libraries folder so the path looks like libraries/twitteroauth/twitteroauth/twitteroauth.php
  Go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps and create a new application. Follow the given instructions. You will need the information provided at the dashboard later
  In your site go to admin/config/services/jquery-twitter-search

  Now add your own block in the jQuery Twitter Search blocks list and configure it to your needs. Check http://jquery.malsup.com/twitter/ for more information
