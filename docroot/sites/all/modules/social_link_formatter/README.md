Drupal Social Link Formatter
============================

![Drupal Social Link Formatter](https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/social_link_formatter.png)

Social Link Formatter is a Drupal module that adds a new formatter for link fields that renders a link as an appropriate icon linking to the destiny if the link is related to a social network. The icon is guessed automatically from the hostname of the link. If the hostname is not related to a supported social network, then no icon is rendered.

This module depends on modules "link" and "fontawesome" (so, it's necessary to download the FontAwesome library to `sites/all/libraries`).

It has just one setting, which is the icon size, that can assume four values: very small, small, medium (which is the default) and large.

Check the module on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_link_formatter).
