Community Media TV Schedules provides an easy way to display TV schedules like you see on RETN.org and MNN.org websites. This module integrates with Community Media Airings, Community Media Show, and Community Media Project to display airing entities and provide click-through links to shows and projects.

Refer to the documentation page for installation and configuration. You can also watch a screencast at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBUqSLrrQb8.

This module is contributed and supported by RETN, with the generous approval of MNN to mimic their schedule design.
