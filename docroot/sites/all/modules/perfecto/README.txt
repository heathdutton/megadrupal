Perfecto
========

The Perfecto module allows compositions to be floated over your web page to
quickly and accurately calibrate the theme CSS.

Description
===========

Save your composition from Photoshop, FireWorks etc to jpg or png, upload
using admin/settings/perfecto, move your mouse to top right corner
of viewport and choose one of the files. A semi-transparent version
of your composition will show up. You can move it around by:
1) holding down ctrl + left mouse button and moving mouse,
2) clicking on arrow icons in the control panel,
3) pressing arrow keys on your keyboard while holding down ctrl.

Use shift key if you want to move composition by 10px. This does
not work while dragging.

Because composition is actually under your page, any links, selects etc are
clickable (just release ctrl).
