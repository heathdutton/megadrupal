This module provides an extension to the existing Commerce Fancy
Attributes module ,it also extends Commerce Search API module ,to
display facets based on the images uploaded in a taxonomy term for
example Color in an apparel product.

The functionality is written in such a way that if a color image is
not found, then it tries to find if a color hex exists, and if that is
not found, it tries to load the default image for the taxonomy field
for color image, and if that is not found it gracefully decays to a
list item with title.

Usage
-----

Example usage:
0) Enable this module.
1) Create a Color vocabulary, add a text field called "Color Hex" that
will hold hex values. Go to "Manage Display", click the tab called
"Add to Cart form - Attribute", enable only the color field (with the
label hidden).
2) Add an image field called "Color Image" that will hold the images
for the color Go to "Manage Display", click the tab called "Add to
Cart form - Attribute", enable "color image" field, make sure you give
the display as "Color Image" (with the label hidden).
3) Create several terms with matching hex colors (Black: #cccccc,
White: #ffffff, etc).  Optionally you can upload images for these
colors too.
4) Add a Color taxonomy_term_reference field to a product type.
5) On the Field UI edit page for the Color field, select "Rendered
term" as the attribute type.

The Add To Cart form will now show the colors.

To enable these color images to appear in Faceted Search, go to the
"Configure Facet Display" page of the respective Facet and from the
"Display Widget" select Fancy attributes (with Images), save the
settings and now your facets should display the images / hex codes in
the Faceted search page.
