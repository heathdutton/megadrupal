ABOUT DEVELOPER DOCS
------------

Developer Docs module is used to generate a module document based on the
functions, annotations and other drupal entities. It may not be accurate
if the module doesn't follow the coding standards.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.


 * You may want to disable Module Filter module, since its output clashes with
   Module listing Page (admin/modules).

CONFIGURATION
-------------
The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, the module will generate module list at admin/reports/developer-docs/.
