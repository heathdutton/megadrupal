Featured News installation instructions
======================================

Just activate the module and create a few "new" items at node/add/new.

If you mark the option "Promoted to front page" (located within the "Publishing options" tab) 
it will be listed in the "Featured news" header at /news. If not, it will appear in the paged
listing.

News listed as Featured are not listed in the paged listing.
