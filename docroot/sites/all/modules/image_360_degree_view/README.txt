DESCRIPTION/FEATURES
--------------------

  This module allows you to use series of real photographs taken at fixed
  intervals in the right sequence around the object and combine them for a
  single interactive image. The image can auto rotate, and the user can 'grab'
  the image and rotate the product to any angle.

  This is a perfect solution for online retailers or manufacturers to take their
  online shopping experience to the next level by bringing their online catalog
  to life with 360° product views and providing a virtual tour of products. The
  module is also a great option for online galleries/museums or auction houses
  where they can provide their visitors a full 360° view of any object.
