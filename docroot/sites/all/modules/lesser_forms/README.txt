INTRODUCTION
------------
Lesser Forms was brought to life with the idea of simplyfing the UI for editors.
Options in Drupal like Authoring information and URL path settings mean nothing
to a content editor (at least not for all).
That's where LF comes in. Simply remove it by checking some options.

INSTALLATION
------------
Place the lesser_forms folder under /sites/all/modules/contrib and head over to
your Drupal modules page to install it.
You can optionally download/install it through Drush.

USAGE
-----
Lesser Forms settings is available under
'Configuration > Content authoring > Lesser forms'
or (admin/config/content/lesser_forms).
 Select the roles you want to activate it for.
 Select the options you want to disable in the UI.
 Save your changes.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Lesser Forms is only compatible with Drupal 7.x
