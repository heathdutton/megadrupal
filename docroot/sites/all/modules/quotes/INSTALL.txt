quotes.module
INSTALL.txt

For a new installation, copy the entire quotes module directory to the
appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation. Then log
into your site, enable the quotes module on the admin/modules
page, set permissions as desired on admin/people/permissions,
and go to the admin/config/quotes page to create and configure the
quote blocks.

When upgrading from a previous version of the quotes module, log into
your site as administrative user 1, replace the existing quotes module
directory with the new one, and then go to the /update.php page to
check for and run any necessary upgrades for the quotes module.

If you are upgrading from a pre-4.5 version, you will need to export
and re-import your existing quotes from your pre-4.5 database or
upgrade to Drupal 4.6, to 4.7, and then to 5.

If you are upgrading from Drupal 5, please update to Drupal 6.16. This is
also a required step if your planning to skip Drupal 6 and go straight to
Drupal 7. A note of caution, if you do skip Drupal 6 in your migration path
be sure that you log into Drupal 6.16 and enable all your modules before
proceeding with the upgrade to Drupal 7. If you do not then you will lose all
your quotes as Drupal 7 wipes out all node bodies if it does not find where
module has been enabled before the upgrade.

The quotes module has five permissions:

* administer quotes:
    allows users to administer the quotes module and
    create/configure/delete quote blocks
* create quotes:
    allows users to create quotes (they cannot edit quotes without the
    'edit own quotes' permisssion)
* import quotes:
    allows users to import quotes (they cannot edit quotes without the
    'edit own quotes' permission)
* edit own quotes:
    allows users to create, edit, and delete quotes
* promote quotes to block:
    allows users to promote their quotes so that they will appear in
    any defined quote blocks
