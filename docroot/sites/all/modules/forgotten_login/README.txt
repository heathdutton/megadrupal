WHAT IS FORGOTTEN LOGIN?
------------

Without realizing it, your Drupal site is losing customers / subscribers because
they can't log in. A surprising proportion of people fail to understand that the
user login form provides a request password facility. To overcome this, we have
written "Forgotten Login", which monitors and reacts to failed logins.

It is designed to help users of your site who have attempted and failed to login
X number of times, after which a customizable e-mail is automatically sent to
the user with the Drupal one time login URL so they can login and reset their
password.

This module is valuable for any ecommerce, ubercart or membership based website
where users are valuable. It emits the fact that you care about your users.

INSTALLATION
