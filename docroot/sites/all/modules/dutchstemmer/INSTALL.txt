Readme
------

This module implements the Dutch stemming algorithm to improve Dutch-language
searching with the Drupal built-in search.module.

It reduces each word in the index to its basic root or stem so that variations
on a word (e.g. "boom, bomen" or "opheffen, opheffing, opheffende") are
considered equivalent when searching. This generally results in more
relevant results.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the dutchstemmer folder to the Drupal modules/ folder.

2. Go to 'administer > modules', and enable the dutchstemmer.module
