inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-07-12
---------------------------
- Release 7.x-6.4.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-07-02
---------------------------
- Fixed namespace in documentation.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-06-06
---------------------------
- Backend and frontend: category is now an alias of type (instead of vice versa)
  and the use of category is deprecated.
- New instance var code, usable for event or error code.
- Now supports logging via injected PSR-3 logger; instance var (object) logger.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-04-18
---------------------------
- (SimpleComplex Inspect) Frontend: stricter typeOf() array check; some jQuery
  extensions (old dataTables) were erroneously assessed as array.
- (SimpleComplex Inspect) Fixed frontend file:line resolver; failed to identify
  inspect.js self.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-04-05
---------------------------
- Added Features module inspect_test, which builds a content type, and includes
  a node_form_alter which executes some inspections and traces.
- Documentation; max comment line length 80.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-02-14
---------------------------
- Don't check twice if session counting enabled.
- configGet/Set() must be called with non-empty arg $domain if inspect var.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-02-12
---------------------------
- Accommodated to domain specific conf vars (D8 related).
- Removed method cliMode(), use PHP_SAPI === 'cli' instead.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2015-02-12
---------------------------
- Fixed namespace error; uppercase'd ...\Inspect.
- The backbone of Inspect is now an included library,
  \SimpleComplex\Inspect\Inspect (residing in GitHub as a Composer library).
  The concepts and essential code of Inspect was originally developed in
  non-Drupal contexts (like ZZ; a SourceForge project).
  And since Drupal Inspect 7.x-6.0 that backbone has been designed specifically
  to be usable in any PHP context, not only the Drupal context.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-26
---------------------------
* Fixed javascript error in IE<9; output formatting isn't enabled for IE<9 thus related drupal js behavior must reflect that condition.
* Release 7.x-6.3.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-16
---------------------------
* Output max didn't actually default to OUTPUT_DEFAULT, but to the database max_allowed_packet.
* Release 7.x-6.2.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-15
---------------------------
* New option output_max, to override overall max output setting.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-14
---------------------------
* Subtract 5% (and 500 as metadata margin) from max output setting to prevent overly long database queries.
* Frontend output formatting shan't turn folding off (when too long output) for all outputs on a page, only for current output.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-08
---------------------------
* Displaying file and line of call to (non-trace) inspect function/method may actually be turned off using option 'no_fileline' (contrary to previous entry; the difference being that the (equiv.) option used be called 'file_ilne').
* Release 7.x-6.1.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-07
---------------------------
* Increased max depth to 20 (default is still 10).

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-06
---------------------------
* Don't display session counters as 'na:0:1' when session counting is off; use 'i' instead (~ 'i:3' means inspection no. three).

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-04
---------------------------
* Override options when target is 'get' in CLI mode; don't ever enclose CLI 'get' output in HTML tag.
* Let 'get' methods end with newline, to work better in CLI mode.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-11-01
---------------------------
* Static methods permit() and severity() are now public.
* $options now support 'type' as alias of 'category', because Drupal coders will be used to Drupal watchdog()'s $type parameter (and the meaning is the exact same).

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-10-31
---------------------------
* Protected instance vars shan't be overridable by $options argument.
* Log a trace if severity is (int) out of bounds or (string) unsupported.

---------------------------
* Profiler statistics shan't assume that all statuses are non-empty.
* Don't iterate object to get number of buckets.
* Dirs/files more PSR-4 compliant.
* Session counting is now an option (default off).

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-08-10
---------------------------
* Separated JS; inspect vs. drupal.inspect.
* Backend now uses file names instead class/function names to filter Inspect frames from traces.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-08-03
---------------------------
* Frontend formatter no longer do any work on trace outputs.
* Namespacing and separation of generic vs. Drupal code.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-29
---------------------------
* The frontend library no longer has settings.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-25
---------------------------
* Link frontend inspector in .info.
* Frontend inspect.browser now additionally reports Firefox as gecko and IE as trident.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-24
---------------------------
* Don't HTML escape when logging to file.
* Now replaces singular backslash (with _BS_) when logging to watchdog.
* Changed path removal/replacement algo; was overly complex and it attempted (and failed) to do some (Windows) backslash directory separator matching.
* Added filing method to profiler.
* Reverted default string truncation to 1000.
* String quotes are now `backtick` instead of >>greater/lesser than<<.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-23
---------------------------
* Added the NUL char to string replacement.
* Strings now also get lower ASCII escaped (when logging to watchdog); regardless of the (optional) needles/replacers. However, the output of Inspect still contains newlines (for formatting).

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-21
---------------------------
* For tracer, default inspection depth is now 2.
* Functions/methods for inspecting function arguments and constants log an error - and they won't exist in next version.
* Fixed bug in numberToString().
* Fixed profiler code format; removed protected members' underscore prefix.

inspect 7.x-6.x, 2014-07-20
---------------------------
* Going real object oriented; the public properties of an Inspect/InspectTrace object are now equivalent to options of an inspection/trace.
* Renamed static methods: _permit -> permit, ensureDir -> ensureDirectory, _log -> logToWatchdog, _file -> logToFile, _logFromFrontend -> logFromFrontend, _fileLine -> fileLine.
* Single maximum output length var, which covers all types of output (get|log|file).
* For tracer, integer value of $options arg is now interpreted as severiy (instead of limit).

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2014-07-16
---------------------------
* The frontend javascript variable/trace inspector is now always available; can no longer be turned off using permissions.
* Removed effectively obsolete permissions 'inspect administer' and 'inspect profile administer'.
* Removed tracer's overriding depth and truncation defaults.
* Increased default string truncation to 10000, and made it configurable and applied to tracing as well as inspection.
* Removed obsolete methods (since 7.x-4.0) Inspect::log_db() and ::log_db().

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2014-07-11
---------------------------
* Removed option 'Allow Cron to log inspections of variables and traces'; use drush cron instead (drush/CLI is always allowed to log).
* Removed syslog compatibility; a waste of time because the outputs of Inspect are almost always too long to be of any use in syslog.
* Increased max exec time percent to 90 (from 70).
* Displaying file and line of call to inspect function/method is no longer an option that can be turned off.
* Turning output folding off per inspection - 'no_folding' - is no longer an option; but folding may still be turned off globally.
* Save paths in variable, too expensive to do at every init.

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2014-05-24
---------------------------
* Don't enforce max_execution_time limit if there isn't any max (which may be the case in CLI/drush mode).

inspect 7.x-5.1, 2014-04-27
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Released.

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2014-04-27
---------------------------

* Profiler: reduced depth of the session var.
* Inspect::_ensureDir() replaced by public method ensureDir().
* InspectProfile no longer extends Inspect; because not relevant, a waste of time.

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2013-10-02
---------------------------
* Fixed wrong arguments for InspectProfile::event() when measuring profiler's own time.
* Don't use State for simple session var removal; wasted overhead.
* Fixed profiler examples.

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2013-09-18
---------------------------
* Implemented hook_exit() to make ending a profile at shutdown possible (doing it at shutdown does not work because session vars cant be saved that late).

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2013-09-16
---------------------------
* Added convenience functions/methods inspect_profile_start/InspectProfile::start() and inspect_profile_stop/InspectProfile::stop().
* Changed names of begin/end functions and methods.

---------------------------
* Fixed that Inspect file/line method shan't consider Inspect Profile an inspector.
* Added profiler event stop option 'if_started', and profile end option 'at_shutdown'.

* Created profile permission 'inspect profile reports' for generating/accessing profiling reports.

inspect 7.x-5.x, 2013-09-06

inspect 7.x-3.x, 2013-03-23
---------------------------
* Now uses singular development branch.
* Removed obsolete and deprecated classes InspectBs, InspectVar, InspectTrc and methods Inspect::_initSessionNo and functions inspect_log_get, inspect_trace_log_get, and Javascript functions variable and variableGet.

inspect 7.x-3.4.x, 2013-02-16
-----------------------------
* Made string truncation default and minimum the same for tracer as inspector (truncated sql strings are fairly useless).

inspect 7.x-3.3, 2013-02-10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released 7.x-3.3.x as 7.x-3.3.


inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-02-10
-----------------------------
* Reverted previous change (Moved adding the frontend library from hook_preprocess_html...), because it's just such a bad idea to a lot of work for every kind of request (even AJAX requests).
* Prepared for new release.

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-02-09
-----------------------------
* Moved adding the frontend library from hook_preprocess_html() to hook_init() implementation, to secure order of library includes.

-----------------------------
* New frontend function .errorHandler() usable as default error handler for other libraries etc.
* Backend inspect_log_message() now logs file and line of the call, using new method Inspect::logMessage().
* Frontend .trace() and .traceGet() now supports second arg as object.message; to conform with other function's parameter signatures.
* Reverted to use hook_init() implementation instead of hook_boot(); forgot to actually rename the function (see inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-22).

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-26
-----------------------------
* Made settings page's display of empty cron_key safer.

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-23
-----------------------------
* Fixed minor bug in InspectTrace's trace analyzer; failed to filter out nested Inspect method/function invocation.

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-22
-----------------------------
* Reverted to use hook_init() implementation instead of hook_boot(), because too risky; too much unavailable or uninitialized stuff. Set module weight to -1000 instead.

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-02
-----------------------------
* Removed @ error suppression from setcookie() calls. Error supposedly fixed (inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-06-20) had nothing to do with setcookie() in CLI mode (the error was in fact undeclared vars).

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2013-01-02
-----------------------------
* Removed message replacement in calls to watchdog(); doesnt make sense, and makes un-translated log messages useless.

inspect 7.x-3.3.x, 2012-12-15
-----------------------------
* Backend checked for unsafe uses of $_SERVER-variables, and modified accordingly.
* Backend now replaces path/document root case insensitive.

-----------------------------
* Fixed inspection formatting and folding of javascript functions.

inspect 7.x-3.1.x, 2012-10-16
-----------------------------

* Fixed bug in backend inspector; max depth variable wasnt initialized.

inspect 7.x-3.1.x, 2012-10-15
-----------------------------
* Logging message to database or file (not inspection/trace/profile) is now only allowed if user has the 'inspect log' permission (previously the intention was no permission check at all, but actually it was only permitted when user had either the 'inspect log' or 'inspect get' permission).
* New function inspect_file_message().
* Now uses drupal_strlen() and drupal_substr() instead of custom methods.
* Finished frontend to backend logging.
* The format of frontend inspections now equals the format of backend ditto.

inspect 7.x-3.1.x, 2012-10-14
-----------------------------

inspect 7.x-3.1.x, 2012-10-13
-----------------------------

-----------------------------
* Better info in traces created by deprecated methods.

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-09-16
-----------------------------
* Moved administrative resources to new module admin folder.
* Fixed t() concatenation errors.
* Now uses request_uri() instead of the server variable.
* Fixed various syntactic/code format issues (Code Review).

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-08-30
-----------------------------
* Fixed bad return in InspecTrace::get().

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-08-26

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-07-31
-----------------------------
* Drush/cli is now always allowed to log inspections/traces/profiles.
* Removed check for wrong arguments in InspectProfile::event(); the method initially had other parameter signature than now.
* Deprecated inspect_trace_log_get()/InspectTrc::log_get() now only logs call to itself, not also trace of the original exception/backtrace.
* InspectTrc refactored; had too complex structure, originally dictated by dual output function/method inspect_trace_log_get()/InspectTrc::log_get().

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-07-25
-----------------------------
* Frontend .typeOf() now examines properties of object in try-catch; makes inspect() report more accurately for built-in objects, like events.
* Backend: hook implementation that includes Javascript now implements hook_preprocess_html (instead of hook_init).

inspect 7.x-2.6.x, 2012-07-10
-----------------------------
* Options enclose_tag_log/enclose_tag_get replaced by option enclose_tag, newline_log/newline_get replaced by newline.
