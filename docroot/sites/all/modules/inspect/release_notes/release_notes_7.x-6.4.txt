Inspect 7.x-6.4


Main issues
-----------
The backbone of Inspect is now an included library,
\SimpleComplex\Inspect\Inspect (residing in GitHub as a Composer library).

New features
------------
- New option 'code', usable for event or error code.
- Now supports logging via injected PSR-3 logger; options (object) 'logger'.
- Backend and frontend: category is now an alias of type (instead of vice versa)
  and the use of category is deprecated.
- A Features-based test module, which builds a content type and implements
  a node_form_alter which executes some inspections and traces.

Bug fixes
---------
- Frontend: stricter typeOf() array check.
- Fixed frontend file:line resolver; failed to identify inspect.js self.

Security
--------
None.

Install/update notes
--------------------
- Clear cache.
