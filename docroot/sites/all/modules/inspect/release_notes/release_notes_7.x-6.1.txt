Inspect 7.x-6.1


Main issues
-----------
Minor maintenance update, which fixed a series of minor annoyances.

New features
------------
* $options now support 'type' as alias of 'category', because Drupal coders will be used to Drupal watchdog()'s $type parameter (and the meaning is the exact same).
* Increased max depth to 20 (default is still 10).
* Don't display session counters as 'na:0:1' when session counting is off; use 'i' instead (~ 'i:3' means inspection no. three).
* Override options when target is 'get' in CLI mode; don't ever enclose CLI 'get' output in HTML tag.
* Let 'get' methods end with newline, to work better in CLI mode.
* Static methods permit() and severity() are now public.
* Displaying file and line of call to (non-trace) inspect function/method may actually be turned off using option 'no_fileline' (contrary to previous entry; the difference being that the (equiv.) option used be called 'file_ilne').
