Inspect 7.x-3.1


The main subjects of this release are all frontend related
----------------------------------------------------------
 * Logging frontend inspections and traces to backend
 * Frontend functions for inspecting events.
 * New frontend option 'func_body' for printing/logging bodies of functions.


Security issues
---------------
 * Logging message to database or file (not inspection/trace/profile) is now only allowed if user has the 'inspect log' permission (previously the intention was no permission check at all, but actually it was only permitted when user had either the 'inspect log' or 'inspect get' permission).
 * Backend inspector no longer escape strings when output target is file.
 * The cookie for counting page loads/requests is no more set httponly because frontend must be able to read it.

New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
 * Functions/methods logging to database now prints page load number and requests number (instead of a number reflecting number of requests using Inspect).
 * Now uses drupal_strlen() and drupal_substr() instead of custom methods.
 * New function inspect_file_message(); same as Inspect::log_file().

Frontend (Javascript)
 * The format of frontend inspections now equals the format of backend ditto.
 * Frontend folding is now turned off using Drupal.settings instead of ugly inline block.

Bug fixes
---------
Backend (PHP)
 * Fixed bug in backend inspector; max depth variable wasnt initialized.
