Inspect 7.x-6.0


Main issues
-----------
 * Simplification: removed a lot of nice-to-haves to make architecture (and maintenance) more effective.
 * Page cache compliancy: the included Javascript files are now always the same, and Inspect no longer sets/updates a cookie at every request.
 * Going real object oriented; the public properties of an Inspect object are now equivalent to options of an inspection/trace.
 * Overall architecture aimed at reusablity across Drupal 7/8 versions (Inspect core separated and attempted to follow PSR-4 principles).


New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
 * For tracer, integer value of $options arg is now interpreted as severiy (instead of limit).
 * Default string truncation is now a setting.
 * Increased max exec time percent to 90 (from 70).
 * Single maximum output length var, which covers all types of output (get|log|file).
 * For tracer, default inspection depth is now 2.
 * Replace singular backslash (with _BS_) when logging to watchdog.
 * Strings now also get lower ASCII escaped (when logging to watchdog); regardless of the (optional) needles/replacers.
   However, the output of Inspect still contains newlines (for formatting).
 * Don't HTML escape when logging to file.
 * Session counting is now an option (default off).

Frontend (Javascript)
 * The frontend javascript variable/trace inspector is now always available; can no longer be turned off using permissions.

Obsolete/removed features
-------------------------
Backend (PHP)
 * Functions/methods for inspecting function arguments and constants log an error - and they won't exist in next version.
 * Methods of InspectTrace are now methods of Inspect self, and InspectTrace methods log an error - and they won't exist (nor will the class InspectTrace) in next version.
 * Removed permissions 'inspect frontend', 'inspect administer', 'inspect profile administer'.
 * Removed option 'Allow Cron to log inspections of variables and traces'; use drush cron instead (drush/CLI is always allowed to log).
 * Removed syslog compatibility; a waste of time because the outputs of Inspect are almost always too long to be of any use in syslog.
 * Displaying file and line of call to inspect function/method is no longer an option that can be turned off.
 * Turning output folding off per inspection - 'no_folding' - is no longer an option; but folding may still be turned off globally.

Bug fixes
---------
Backend (PHP)
 * Inspect effectively didn't work in drush/CLI mode (since Inspect 5.0; max execution time).
 * Fixed bug in numberToString().
 * Profiler statistics shan't assume that all statuses are non-empty.


Security
--------
 * Removed permissions 'inspect frontend', 'inspect administer', 'inspect profile administer'.


Install/update notes
--------------------
 * Update database
 * Clear all cache
