Inspect 7.x-2.0

The main subjects of this release are:

Simplified permissions model
----------------------------
Fine-grained permissions is of little use if too complex.
Turning of logging of paths/scalars - and getting scalars - is no more something controllable by permissions.
Paths and scalars may however still be turned off per dump/trace via the options parameter (hide_paths/hide_scalars).
The backend inspector is pretty good at hiding absolute paths.
And hiding scalars usually makes a dump/trace rather useless.

Expandable/collapsible variable dumps
-------------------------------------
Backend variable dumps are now expandable/collapsible.
Container descendants may be expanded/collapsed individually as well as for all.
The folding mechanism is implemented solely via javascripting; the PHP analysis and rendering is not affected at all.
Traces are not being folded, and the variable dump folding is btw not supported for Internet Explorer <9 (and will never be).

Variable dumps display file and line
-------------------------------------
Inspections now default to display file and line of the call to an Inspect function/method, backend as well as frontend.

A profiler
----------
Simple execution time profiler, which logs profiles to file at shutdown.
Profiles are also accessible via logging and getting.


Security issues
---------------
Backend (PHP)
 * Added permission 'inspect profile'.
 * Removed permission 'inspect log paths'. _Logging_ paths is now always allowed, but may still be prevented by using the 'hide_paths' option.
 * Removed permission 'inspect log scalars'. _Logging_ scalars is now always allowed, but may still be prevented by using the 'hide_scalars' option.
 * Removed permission 'inspect get scalars'. _Getting_ scalars is now always allowed, but may still be prevented by using the 'hide_scalars' option.
 * Now strings are also escaped using htmlspecialchars(), aside from the needles/replacer options replacement.
 * String truncation is now UTF-8 safe, and strings are also being checked for UTF-8 validity.
 * The message option value is now being escaped.
 * Inspect's session number now uses cookie as fallback from $_SESSION var.
 * Changed interpretation of all options arguments, to support direct name/message arg.

Frontend (Javascript)
 * Removed administrative option to omit linking dummy javascript inspector for users missing the 'inspect frontend' permission.


New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
 * Now supports expandable/collapsible variable dumps.
 * Displays file and line of inspection call.
 * New function arguments inspector inspect_args()/InspectVar::args().
 * A basic execution time profiler, inspect_profile()/InspectProfile::event().
 * Changed default delimiter between object/array buckets from carriage return to newline.

Frontend (Javascript)
 * Displays file and line of inspection call, except when called in browser console.
 * New function .toggleDisplay, which toggles display of backend variable dumps.
 * New function .toggleFolding, which toggles folding of backend variable dumps.


Bug fixes
---------
Backend (PHP)
 * Severe character set bug (http://drupal.org/node/1493404) which sometimes resulted in PDOException when logging inspection.
Frontend (Javascript)
 * .typeOf() failed when given no argument.
