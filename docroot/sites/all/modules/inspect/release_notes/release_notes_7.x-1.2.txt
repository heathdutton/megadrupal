Inspect 7.x-1.2

This release only changes the frontend inspector - no changes to the backend inspector at all.
It also introduces two new configuration options.
And now includes .install script, which removes configuration variables when un-installing.

New features
------------
Backend (PHP)
 * none
Frontend (Javascript)
 * changed parameter signatures of inspect(), .variable(), .variableGet();
options object instead of 3 args of fairly arbitrary sequence
 * but still supports integer depth/string message for that second (options) parameter
 * added configuration option: add surrogate 'noaction' frontend script when user misses the frontend inspection permission
(to prevent errors due to non-existing functions)
 * added minified versions of the frontend scripts
 * added configuration option: use source versions of frontend scripts instead of minified versions

Bug fixes
---------
Backend (PHP)
 * none
Frontend (Javascript)
 * fixed bug which prevented the (max) depth parameter from having much effect at all
