SimpleComplex Inspect 1.0, 2015-07-12


Main issues
-----------
First release as a framework independent library, after a life as embedded code
in a Drupal module and (earlier) in ZZ Web Application Platform (an experimental
project released at sourceforge.net).

New features
------------
- New option 'code', usable for event or error code.
- Now supports logging via injected PSR-3 logger; instance var (object) logger.
- Backend and frontend: category is now an alias of type (instead of vice versa)
  and the use of category is deprecated.

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed frontend file:line resolver; failed to identify inspect.js self.
- Frontend: stricter typeOf() array check; some jQuery extensions (old
  dataTables) were erroneously assessed as array.

Security
--------
- None.
