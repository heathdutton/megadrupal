Ban User
========
http://drupal.org/project/ban_user

There are times, especially in a site used as a forum, when some users have to be banned temporarily because of their 
behavior not complying with the norms and expectations of all the other users. The Ban User module helps under these 
circumstances.

Users can be banned for a definite time period. When they try to log in, they will be refused and informed in a message 
about the ban and the deadline when they can log in again. If they are currently online when the administrator (or any 
other user with the necessary privileges, eg. a moderator in a forum) is forced to ban them, they will be logged out 
immediately.

When the deadline is reached, the ban will be lifted without extra intervention from the administrator.
