 * This module uses the question interface to define something which is actually

 * A Quiz Directions node is a placeholder for adding directions to a quiz. It
 * can be inserted any number of times into a quiz. Example uses may include:
 *
 * - Initial quiz-wide directions
 * - Section directions, e.g. "The next five questions are multiple choice,
 *    pleaseâ€¦" (Won't work if the question order is randomized)
 * - Final confirmation, e.g. "You have answered all questions. Click submit to
 *    submit this quiz."
