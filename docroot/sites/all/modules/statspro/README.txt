SUMMARY
-------
The Statistics Pro module creates statistics with aggregated data. The data is
stored in a new table, which will be updated with a cron run. This statistic
module provides statistical results of nodes, comments and users. Aggregated
statistical data from nodes, comments and users are stored even if the access
log table or the watchdog table have been deleted. For presenting the data the
Views is used. When Statistics Pro detects the core Statistics module, the
Charts and Graphs module or the Views Charts module it enables specific features
dependent on each one of these modules like page visualization reports and
graphs. This module is not a replacement for the core Statistics module but an
useful enhancement.

OPTIONAL MODULES
----------------
Charts and Graphs 6.x-2.0+ - http://drupal.org/project/charts_graphs
Statistics
Views Charts - http://drupal.org/project/views_charts

* The Views Charts module needs the patch available at
  <http://drupal.org/node/833388> to prevent the presentation of several notices
  if using E_ALL level notification in php.


DEVELOPMENT NOTES
-----------------
The statistics are generated by Cron.  In statspro.module there is an implementation of hook_cron()
which creates a StatsPro object (in statspro.inc), and uses this to generate the stats.
