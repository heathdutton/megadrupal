Quiz Multichoice
====

Allows quiz creators to make a multiple choice question type.

### 1. Introduction

This module is an attempt to make it easy to multiple choice questions using the
quizz module.

The multichoice module lets the user create single answer questions and multiple
answer questions. Advanced feedback and scoring options are also available.

The multichoice module is based on the OO framework of the quizz project.

### 2. Installation

To install, unpack the module to your modules folder, and simply enable the
module at Admin > Build > Modules.

Several database tables prefixed with quiz_multichoice are installed to have a
separate storage for this module.

### 3.  Configuration

Settings are to be found here: admin/quizz/questions_settings

The only available setting is the number of default alternatives. This decides
how many alternatives will be shown on the node-form by default. The question
creator can add more by pushing the add more alternatives button, and he can
always leave some alternatives blank if not all the shown alternatives are needed.
