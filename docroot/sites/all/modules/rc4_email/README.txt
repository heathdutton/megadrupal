## Introduction

This module provides graceful email obfuscation to protect email addresses from
harvesting bots  on mailto  links generated  by the  Drupal l()  function by
obfuscating email  addresses found  in mailto  links and  its link  text. A RC4
ciphertext of the original  email address are saved and is later  decrypted and
reinserted  back to HTML by Javascript, providing a transparent  experience to
sites where a majority of users are using a Javascript-enabled  browser, at the
same time prevents  non-Javascript  capable bots (which at the time of writing,
are the majority of the bots out there) from harvesting email addresses.

## Example

After obfuscation, this:

    <a href="mailto:example.one@example.org">Send email to example.one@example.com</a>

turns into this, but only for bots:

    <a href="mailto:example ! one () example ! org" data-emailurl="H5NkTqSWw54048Y34paoxxdCTz5/yAKUavP6XcL7ZeB24tB4" data-textenc="MYBsVbaWi5lm1dQz4IW/nQVV" class="rc4_email">Send email to example ! one () example ! org</a>

## Requirements

Should work on any Drupal 7 installation as the module brings its own PHP and
Javascript implementation of RC4.

## Installation

Just enable this module and by its default configuration will apply its email
obfuscation to all mailto links generated by Drupal core's l() function.

You may also visit admin/config/content/rc4_email to see how you can change the
way this module acts upon mailto links.

## Recommended modules

As this module only works with  links generated by Drupal's l() function, you
will need other modules that works with emails addresses  that come from some
other sources. We recommend installing one of the following filter modules in
addition to RC4 email to obfuscate email addresses found in l() functions and
text formats. Together  they are a highly  effective way for protecting email
addresses from being harvested from your web sites.

 - [SpamSpan filter](https://drupal.org/project/spamspan)

## Known problems

This module currently strip tags in the link text regardless of HTML flag in
l() $options array.
