# Menu Select

Replaces Drupal's stock node parent menu item selector with a hierarchal collapsible unordered list. Offers a breadcrumb preview of the menu item's location and an optional autocomplete search.

If this module is installed on site using a Drupal core version 7.34 or less, this patch is required to use the autocomplete search functionality.

## Config

Found on admin/config/content/menu-select, admins can change the cut off length for menus to auto-expand or not, and also enable the autocomplete search if they applied the Drupal core patch mentioned above.
