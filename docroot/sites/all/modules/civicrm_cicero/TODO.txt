To do for next stage:

* Add School District, and State Assembly and Senate (we only have one
  state district) to available cicero fields.

* In civicrm_cicero_sync_runs table, add field to record drupal user
  id of user who schedued it (filled in when schedule) and the name of
  the cicero user used to connect (filled in at cron run time).

* Display contents of civicrm_cicero_sync_runs, with pager, and cancel
  link, on same page that you add a new schedule.

* Include global drop down option to select a CiviCRM contact field for
  recording date/time a contact was last sync'ed to cicero. Then, when
  cicero runs for a contact, update this field with the current
  date/time.

* When running, reject addresses without address, city, state and
  country must be empty or United States (check with Cicero people)

* Build CSV file of all elected officials - email to the person who
  scheduled the job

* Order fields listed in field mapping drop down by Custom Data Group,
  then Field label. Include Custom Data Group in the display value, e.g.

  Core Info::Birth date
  Core Info::Gender
  Voter Info::District Id
  Voter Info::State Id
