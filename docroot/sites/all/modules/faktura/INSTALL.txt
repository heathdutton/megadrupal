1. INSTALL FAKTURA

ATTENTION: We recommend to have a look on our installation profile for Faktura
on http://www.kommune3.org/faktura/download

In order to install Faktura, just extract the Faktura module to your systems
module folder and activate the module on the Drupal modules page.

REQUIREMENTS

Faktura currently requires the following modules

auto_nodetitle, computed_field, ctools, date, date_api, date_popup, date_repeat,
date_repeat_field, date_tools, date_views, entity, features, field_collection,
field_collection_table, field_ui, file, list, node_reference, number,
page_manager, panels, php, rules, rules_admin, rules_link, rules_scheduler,
serial, token, views, views_bulk_operations, views_content, views_ui, workflow


2. EXPORT DOCUMENTS TO ODT

If you want to use the odt template system to export documents (invoices, dunnig
letters, etc.) to odt, you have to download our modified odtPHP library from

    http://www.kommune3.org/faktura/download

You could also get the odtPHP library directly from its project page on
http://www.odtphp.com but notice, that this version would not work with PDF
export function.


3. CONVERT DOCUMENTS TO PDF

In order to convert generated odt documents to PDF you should have the export
to odt function working as described above. To convert the created odt files to
the PDF format, be sure to have a working version of OpenOffice installed on
your server. This is a step where normal shared hosting packages reach there
limit.

Now install the JODConverter from http://artofsolving.com/opensource/jodconverter

Theres a shell script in the modified odtPHP library folder which calls the
JODConverter. Ensure to make it executeable by the webserver.

Thats it!
