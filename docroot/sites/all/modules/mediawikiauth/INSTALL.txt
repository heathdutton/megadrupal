Mediawiki - Drupal authentication integration
=============================================

Installation instructions
-------------------------

This file was originally distributed with AuthDrupal v 0.6, 2008-06-20.

Those instructions concern only the Drupal part of the integration.

First, install the Mediawiki extension and configure it according to its
install instructions. See:

http://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Extension:AuthDrupal

 1. install the module in sites/all/modules/mediawikiauth
 2. You need to assign a key to use to encode the username to prevent spoofing.
    Make up a key string (something unique, think of it as a password) and set
    the same value for wgAuthDrupal_security_key in mediawikiauth.module.
 3. Edit the other settings at the top of mediawikiauth.module so that
    each item matches what you have set in LocalSettings.php. If you have
    multiple wikis sharing the same Drupal login, create a block of
    settings for each wiki. If you only have one wiki, delete the second
    example settings.
 4. Go into Drupal admin pages and enable the Mediawiki module

Things should work at this point. If behavior is funny at first, delete the
cookies for your domain, and try it again with a fresh start.
