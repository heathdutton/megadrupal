Mediawiki Auth Bridge 5.x-0.7.x, 2009-04-01
-------------------------------------------

The Drupal part of this module is now maintained on Drupal.org. The
rationale behind this move is that Mediawiki *and* Drupal are moving
targets, and we need seperate branches to track each system.

Mediawiki Auth Bridge < 0.6.x
-----------------------------

Those are the releases that happened before the appearance on
Drupal.org.

* v 0.6.1 - 2008-07
 * one of the files had whitespace after the closing php tag. oops! fixed.
* v 0.6 - 2008-06
 * removed use of mcrypt and replaced with weaker home-grown username encoding.
 * made support for user roles optional, turned off by default, and now allows only some roles to be propagated. (This is not well tested.)
* v 0.5 - 2007-09
 * corrected return values from hook functions as suggested by anisotropic in http://drupal.org/node/177258#comment-273705
 * added support for pulling user roles from Drupal and setting them as group membership on the MW user object. updateUser() is now called for existing session as well as new session to ensure user roles are pulled fresh from Drupal.
* 0.4: Added support to allow multiple wikis sharing the same Drupal login front page; user is always logged in to all at the same time and logged out from all at the same time. 23:12, 29 July 2007 (UTC)
* 0.3.2: Fix for MW 1.10.1 and some code reformatting.
 * IP address check removed. Code used to check that user's IP address has remained the same between login to Drupal and visit to the wiki. This meant e.g. if you moved to another wifi network with your laptop, the authentication would fail such that the login/logout links at the op were in an inconsistent state. 21:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
