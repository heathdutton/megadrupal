DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
The Content Optimizer module helps increase your Drupal site's search engine (e.g. Google) rankings by improving on-page optimization factors. It provides an instant analysis of any site content as a quick and easy guide to assure optimization best practices are consistently followed. The analysis displays vital content statistics and recommendations for improving search engine rankings. 

INSTALLATION
---------------
- Upload the Content optimizer directory to a modules directory on your server such as sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules.
- You will also need the Content Analysis (drupal.org/project/contentanalysis) and Chaos Tools (drupal.org/project/ctools) modules. If you do not have them installed, download them and follow the instructions for installing.
- Enable the module via the admin > site building > modules
- Edit any existing node or add a node and you will see a new fieldset called "Content analysis". Add a keyword phrase you want to target for the node and click the "Analyze content" button. 
- To change any settings go to Site configuration > Content optimizer
