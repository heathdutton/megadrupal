Provides a Views field that prints out the current path of the page being viewed.

-- USAGE --

Create/edit your view and add a new field. In the "Add fields" window, choose
"Global: Current Path". Configure the field options and apply it to your display.

Although there are many use-cases for this functionality, the most common use is
taking advantage of the "Rewrite results" section in other fields where you can use
this field token (i.e. [current_path]) in the text or adding it to the "Output this field
as a link" input box.
