Hierarchical Term Formatter
===========================

This module provides hierarchical term formatters for taxonomy reference 
fields. In other words, it can display a taxonomy term reference on, say, a 
node as "Parent > Child", rather than just "Child".

Features
--------
* Uses standard taxonomy term reference fields.
* Displays all parents of the referenced term, as well as the term itself. Can 
  also be configured to only show the parents, or just the root parent term.
* Optionally links terms to their term pages.
* Choose from a variety of wrapper elements, or no extra markup.

Usage
-----
Install and enable the module. Go to Admin » Structure » Content types and 
open the Display settings page for a taxonomy term field. (Such fields can 
also be available on other entities than nodes.)

Choose the Hierarchical terms formatter and click the cog wheel to configure 
the formatter.
