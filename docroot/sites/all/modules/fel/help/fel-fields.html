<p>
Form element layout fields module (fel_fields.module) will allow end users to
configure the description position of field help texts to be either before or
after (default) the input element in the field settings UI. This works for all
field types Drupal core provides in addition to a few popular contrib field
modules.
</p>

<h3>Implement support for fel_fields.module</h3>

<p>
Working with field forms in Drupal is complex and field widget implementors is
free to structure the field widget form however they like, independent of the
field storage model. This makes adding support for all imaginable field types
hard and difficult to maintain.
</p>

<p>
fel_fields.module uses CTools plugin to provide individual field widget support,
and this is the recommended way for other field widget modules to add support
for FEL. The plugin is called <strong>description_display</strong> and the its
purpose is to let fel_fields.module know what columns or rather child elements
the field <strong>#description</strong> resides in and thereby inject the
necessary attributes to move the description according to the field instance
settings.
</p>

<p>
In your field widget module, you first have to tell CTools plugin that you have
a plugin implementation:
</p>

<pre>
/**
 * Implements hook_ctools_plugin_directory().
 */
function example_ctools_plugin_directory($owner, $plugin_type) {
  if ($owner == 'fel_fields') {
    return 'plugins/' . $plugin_type;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
This is the recommended directory structure for CTools plugin and you will then
have to add your plugin in the 'plugins/description_display' folder. So if your
field widget module is called 'example.module', your full plugin path within the
example module folder will be:
</p>

<code>
plugins/description_display/example.inc
</code>

<p>
In its simplest form all you need to do here is specify what child element
within the field form the field's help text or <strong>#description</strong>
resides in, using the 'columns' keyword:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php

$plugin = array(
  'columns' => array(
    'value',
  ),
);
</pre>

<p>
It's also possible to have an empty plugin as a place-holder just to say that
"I've added support for this and there is nothing to do" to avoid having the
potentially expensive fall back behavior run.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php

$plugin = array(
  'columns' => array(),
);
</pre>

<p>
Or you can specify a callback which returns the child elements:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php
$plugin = array(
  'callback' => 'example_description_display_columns',
);

/**
 * Plugin callback.
 */
function example_description_display_columns($field, $instance, $field_form) {
  if ($instance['widget']['type'] == 'widget1') {
    return array('foo');
  }
  if ($instance['widget']['type'] == 'widget2') {
    return array('bar', 'baz');
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
You don't even need to return anything in the callback, and this can be used to
add advanced processing or additional FAPI callbacks (#after_build, #pre_render,
etc), but then you will have to declare your callback function with a reference
to the $field_form:
</p>

<code>
function example_description_display_columns($field, $instance, &$field_form) {
</code>

<p>
The $field_form parameter includes the form for all values in a field, so if a
field uses the default field behavior and is a single value field you still have
to dive into $field_form[0] to access the actual field widget form, or iterate
over all deltas for multi value fields.
</p>

<p>
If the plugin callback doesn't return anything and chooses to process
the <strong>#description_display</strong> attribute itself, please honor the
field configuration for it
in <strong>$instance['settings']['description_display']</strong>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note!</strong> If you choose to add additional FAPI callbacks from this
plugin callback you have to specify a function that is always loaded. This
plugin isn't always loaded during the life cycle of entity field forms.
</p>
