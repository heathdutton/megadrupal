Views nodes split

Overview:
=============================================================================
  This module allows site administrators or builders to have a different view
mode for the first nodes of a view result.

Description:
=============================================================================
  If you ever had (or currently have) this scenario: you have a view of nodes
but you want that the first node (or first X nodes) to have a different view
mode, then this module is for you. The module can split the results from a view
into 2 lists. It actually does not make 2 separate lists, it just uses a
a different view mode to render the first X nodes from a view.
