Region Class Module
===================

Region class is a very simple module. It exposes additional per-region
settings in the theme-settings page. For each region and every block contained
additional CSS classes can be specified. This is handy in conjunction with
Block Groups simplifying the construction of more advanced layouts (like split
sidebar).
