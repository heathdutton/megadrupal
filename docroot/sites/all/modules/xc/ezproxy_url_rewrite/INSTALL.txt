                               INSTALLATION


Installation
------------
Installation is much like any other Drupal moddule. Follow the instrucations
at: http://drupal.org/node/70151


Notes
-----
As with most Drupal modules, simply follow the instructions available at:
http://drupal.org/node/70151


Advanced Options
----------------
Drupal has a bug in the url() function, part of includes/common.inc that
prevents the rewriting of external URLs using custom_url_rewrite_outboud().

If you would like to use this module to rewrite all URLs, you should apply
the included patch for Drupal core. Information about applying patches to
Drupal can be found at: http://drupal.org/patch/apply

You will need the "patch" application and knowledge of using your operating
system's command line. All this information can be found by following the
previous link.

If you have all the requirements to apply the patch on your system, follow
these instructions:

 1. Copy the file, custom_url_rewrite_outbound_external.patch, from the
    EZProxy module directory to the base of your Drupal installation
    directory.

 2. At the command line, from the base of your Drupal installation
    directory, enter the following:

    patch -p0 --binary < custom_url_rewrite_outbound_external.patch

Note: The "--binary" option may not be required on your system.
