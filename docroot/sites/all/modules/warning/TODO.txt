Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

== Themability
- Find out how to add a block of code in the correct place inside the page
  instead of abusing the forms and fieldgroups.
- Make the warnings themable

== Warnings
- Improve and translate the default messages
- Add more warning locations based on user feedback

== Moderation
- Should we make the module work differently when moderation is
  enabled/disabled ?
- We should notify the administrator when comments and/or user registration
  is not moderated
