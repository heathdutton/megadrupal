README.txt for Taxonomy Permissions 7.x-1.x



>>>> Please feel free to suggest improvements and additions to this file! <<<<




Overview
--------

Taxonomy Permissions adds 'view terms in /vocabulary/' permissions to the
list of permissions of the Taxonomy core module.

To avoid surprises, vocabularies are visible by authenticated and anonymous
users by default. You have to change the permissions to see any effect of
this module.
