This is a simple module to report which custom content types exist, and the count of usage for each one.

I built this module to help me know which content types are in use on a site. I find it useful when comparing production sites to their staging and dev versions.

It can be displayed as a standalone page (admin/reports/nodes) or as a block. I like to put it in the right column of Dashboard. There are columns for the type (machine name), the human-friendly name, and the count of instances of each type. Each column head is click-sortable.

It comes with its own permission for visibility; be sure to set it for the roles you want to be able to view the page or block.

It has a style sheet, which you may poverride in your own theme.
