Scribd Input Filter
===================

This module provides an input filter to add a document from Scribd anywhere input filters are accepted. You can choose to embed the document in iPaper or link to the document on Scribd.

In case you did not know: "Scribd is the world's largest social reading and publishing company. We've made it easy to share and discover entertaining, informative and original written content across the web and mobile devices. Our vision is to liberate the written word, to connect people with the information and ideas that matter most to them." (from http://www.scribd.com/about).

To add a document from Scribd to a textarea, simply add the following code to your textarea

<code> 
    [scribd id=xxxx key=yyyy mode=zzzz] 
</code>

where id=xxxx is the document_id from Scribd, key=yyyy is the access_key and mode=zzzz is the optional display mode. 

You can copy the Wordpress filter directly from Scribd, and it will work in Drupal with this filter.
