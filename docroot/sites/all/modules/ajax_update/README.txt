INTRODUCTION
------------

 * This module fixes issues with Drupal 7 AJAX API.
   Currently this module allows for the exclusion of ajax_html_ids on specific 
   forms. Only the ajax_html_ids of the form parent of the ajaxified element
   are excluded.

*  Use-Case:  Suppose you have a form with add-more functionality.  When you 
   click 'add-more', the ajax-html-ids of the previous items are sent to the 
   form builder.  Because there is collision, all of the newly generated 
   elements have different ids than they did before.  But if only the new 
   element is sent to the client, its ID may be inconsistent with the others.  
   On the next submit, the data from the form on the page no longer corresponds 
   to that generated by the form builder, and validation fails.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * Drupal 7.x

INSTALLATION
