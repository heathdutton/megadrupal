DESCRIPTION/FEATURES
--------------------

  This module allows you to post the status on a user’s profile in the form of
  text, image or video status. Logged user can post comments on any user’s
  status. Visitors can only view the status and comments of any user (by
  default). While the permission of View/ Delete/ Edit can also be set by the
  administrator. The user can delete only that post or comment which he/ she has
  submitted to other profile. Posts on user’s own profile can also be easily
  deleted or edited instantly via AJAX.
  
  Also, it allows the user to like his own status or comments as well as other
  user’s status with help of a well known FLAG module. The theming of wall
  status will give you the experience just like the facebook wall.
