YOUR THEME TO MY MODULE
-----------------------


---
It feels so lonely late at night
  wrapping up a piece of code
Looking for some beauty in life
  but there's no API for theme_love_load()
The code might be clean and it might be safe
  but there's something missing
There's too little Drupal love
  my code needs hugging and kissing


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme

I can be your module, you can be my theme


---
Slowly giving up on the Color module
  and everything just seems blue
Can't you see, see – 'kay –
  Can't you see that I need you?
The patch is green and it's performing well

But there's no pretending – we all can tell
  I might be smart but it's ugly as hell


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme


---
I am nothing without you
A displayless View
I'm like Drupal 2.2
  Yeah

I'm an action with no hook
The Drupal course I never took
I'm a pageless book
  Yeah

I'm a string without a t()
I'm a value without key
I am Drupal with a fee
  Yeah

I'm the drush I didn't make
The only thought when I'm awake
I'm a power ballade
  without a solo break -- yeah!


---
*awesome solo*


---
Wrapping up some code late at night
  pushing up a final commit
Looking for some beauty in my life
  but I don't know how to get it
Time to get some sleep and reboot my brain

The keyboard is finally silent
  but the monitor is screaming of pain


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
  Again and again and again...
