Question Pool
===

This module provide a pool question handler, where we can link other questions
types (currently this only support multichoice, truefalse, matching handlers):

- User only need to take 1 right out of all questions in pool to go on the next question in quiz
- User will get max score of pool is one question is passed, min score ~ 0 if all questions in pool fail
