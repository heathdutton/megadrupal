INTRODUCTION
------------
This project is for you if want to programmatically run specific rules
at a predefined time and / or interval. This is done by providing a new
rules reaction event. When applied, the rule will be available as a new
cron job for ultimate cron.

Using ultimate cron you can then set the desired time and or interval
as usual.
