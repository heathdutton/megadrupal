INTRODUCTION
------------

This project provides an admin interface which lists all the fields grouped
under content types (node entities). It's main feature is to make the fields as 
required or optional.

 * This make administrator easy to modify the all content type field's required
   attribute in single interface

 * This saves time for administrator as they don't need to navigate to manage 
   field page for just making the field as required/optional

 * Default Title field will not be displayed in the list
