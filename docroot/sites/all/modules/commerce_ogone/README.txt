DESCRIPTION
===========
Ogone (http://www.ogone.com) integration for the Drupal Commerce payment and checkout system.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMERCE OGONE
============================================

First you should make sure you have an Ogone Merchant account, and are ready to configure it:

Configuring Ogone
------------------
- Log in with your Ogone merchant account to the test or prod environment
  (depending on which you'd like to configure)
- Go to Configuration > Technical information
- Make sure the following settings are properly configured for this module to work:
  TAB "Global security parameters":
  * Hash algorithm: SHA-1
  * Character encoding: UTF-8

  TAB "Data and origin verification"
  * URL of the merchant page containing the payment form that will call the page:orderstandard.asp
    --> make sure to enter your correct domain here
  * SHA-IN Pass phrase (twice!)
    --> Enter a pass phrase here for security purposes, and remember it for later use
  * IP address of your server (for DirectLink - if appropriate)

  TAB "Transaction feedback"
  * No need to fill in Accepturl, Declineurl, Exceptionurl or Cancelurl. They will be handled automatically
  * Check the checkbox "I want to receive transaction feedback parameters on the redirection URLs.",
    unless you intend to use Direct HTTP server-to-server requests.
  * SHA-1-OUT Pass phrase
    --> Enter a pass phrase here for security purposes, and remember it for later use
  * Optionally configure the "Direct HTTP server-to-server request" settings,
    if you would like to have Ogone contact your website directly for payment feedback, rather than providing the feedback on redirect.
    (This will avoid problems with users closing their browser after payment was received, but before the redirect back to your site occurred, and other special cases).
    --> Choose a timing setting that suits you best
    --> Set both post-payment URLs to http://<your_website_address>/commerce-ogone/callback
    --> Request method can be POST or GET
    You can do the same for the setting "HTTP request for status changes" if needed.
  * Dynamic e-Commerce parameters
    --> Define which parameters will be sent back on the transaction feedback. Add AMOUNT and CURRENCY to selected parameters.

Installing & configuring the Ogone payment method in Drupal Commerce
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Enable the module (Go to admin/modules and search in the Commerce (Contrib) fieldset).
- Go to Administration > Store > Configuration > Payment Methods
- Under "Disabled payment method rules", find the Ogone payment method
- Click the 'enable' link
- Once "Ogone" appears in the "Enabled payment method rules", click on it's name to configure
- In the table "Actions", find "Enable payment method: Ogone" and click the link
- Under "Payment settings", you can configure the module:
  * Ogone account: define whether to use the test or production account
  * PSPID: add your Ogone PSPID (the username you use to login as merchant)
  * Currency code: select a currency
  * Language code: let Ogone know in which language the payment screens should be presented
  * SHA-IN Pass phrase: enter the pass phrase you saved while configuring Ogone
  * SHA-1-OUT Pass phrase: enter the pass phrase you saved while configuring Ogone
- You can now process payments with Ogone!

Dynamic templates
=================
Dynamic templates allow you to keep the look of your site on the payment pages.
To use them, create a page containing $$$PAYMENT ZONE$$$ where the content of
the payment page should be displayed. This can be a node page, a page generated
by a custom menu router element or even a static HTML page (note that all
references to images, css and other resources should be using absolute paths).
The absolute URL to this page must be passed as a parameter to
hook_commerce_ogone_data_alter() (see commerce_ogone.api.php). The template page
must be publicly reachable, it will not work on a local development or a
password-protected server.

White-labels and Co-Brands
==========================
Ogone allows banks to integrate its payment platform into their commercial offer
and to thus make the most of the potential of their network by allowing
customers to exploit to a maximum the revenues generated from remote sales
and electronic commerce.

To use such a white-label version of Ogone, change the base URL by setting the
'commerce_ogone_provider_url' to the white-label's URL, for example by adding
the following line to your settings.php file:

  $conf['commerce_ogone_provider_url'] = 'https://payment.example.com/foobar'
