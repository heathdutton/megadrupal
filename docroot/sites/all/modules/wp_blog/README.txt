ABOUT THE WP BLOG MODULE
========================
WordPress provides a great platform for blogging. Drupal provides all the tools
for a great blogging platform, but it takes some effort to join all those tools
together. This module goes some way to addressing that.

The killer features I see in WordPress are:
- A prepackaged content-type for blog posts.
- A date-based navigation system in the sidebar, which shows the years/months
  when blogs were posted, and how many posts were created for that year/month.
- Hackable clean URLs: new posts are created with a permalink URL which
  includes the year, month, and day they were posted, and the title of the
  blog post.
- Free-tagging of blog posts with arbitrary tags.


INSTALLATION
============
1. Copy the module to the appropriate sites/all or sites/nnn directory.
2. Enable the module.
3. Add the "Blog date navigation" to a sidebar (if desired).
4. Get blogging!


FAQ AND BUGS/ISSUES

ROADMAP
=======
- Trackbacks and pingbacks will be supported through a separate module (which
  is currently in development as a port of two Drupal 6 modules).
- A complete WordPress-style Drupal distribution is an aspiration, which
  development support and funding can help bring about sooner!  Contact the
  author through http://drupal.org/user/321496/contact if you'd like to get
  involved or support this project.
