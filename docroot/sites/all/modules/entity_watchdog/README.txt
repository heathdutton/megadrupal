Entity wrapper for dblog so that it can be utilized by anything 
that uses entity api.  This was developed to be used in conjunction 
with restws so that you could query and write to a remote watchdog.
This is useful when you have lots of related sites and don't want to 
be writing to their watchdogs individually.

This is purely a developer tool and has no UI
