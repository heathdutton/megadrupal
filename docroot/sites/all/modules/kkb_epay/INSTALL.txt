REQUIREMENTS
------------

Before using this module, you must receive your personal private key from
the Epay provider. Without a private key, the bank will refuse to accept
any payments from your website.

Please go to https://epay.kkb.kz/, where you can find Terms of Use and
provider's contacts.

This module's maintainer does not distribute private keys or assist in
acquiring one.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

If you plan to use this module as a payment method with Ubercart or Commerce,
naturally, you have to install one of those modules. Other than that, this
module does not have any dependencies or configuration requirements.

1. Install this module as usual.
2. Go to admin/config/services/epay/private-key and input information about
   your private key that you have received from the bank.
3. Follow the instructions on the configuration page: completely copy the
   outputted block of text and place it into your settings.php file without
   modifications; save the changes.
4. Visit the admin/reports/status page and verify private key status â€” if
   everything is done right, your merchant ID will be displayed back to you.
5. If you see a warning that KKB Epay is in a debugging mode, visit the
   admin/config/services/epay/debug page to turn it off.
