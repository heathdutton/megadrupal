/**
 * @file
 * An example module that implements 'kkb_epay' hooks to accept payments.
 *
 * This module demostrates the basic workflow that must be implemented in your
 * module to start accepting payments with Epay. It does not matter whether
 * you are trying to integrate 'kkb_epay' with your e-commerce solution, or
 * you are providing custom subscription bases services; you have to implement
 * the same workflow.
 *
 * There are four steps that you have to take - this module demostrates them:
 *
 *   1. Create an order, invoice, subscription, etc.
 *
 *      It does not matter how you call it, because it is completely internal.
 *      But the order must be created before you ask user to pay it,
 *      it must have a unique numeric ID and an amount.
 *
 *   2. Send a user to a payment page, load your internal order, validate it,
 *      transform into a KkbEpay_Order object, load 'kkb_epay_billing_statement'
 *      form, display it to the user.
 *
 *      'kkb_epay_billing_statement' is the heart of the 'kkb_epay' module. It
 *      contains all information about a payment for the processing center,
 *      such as: payment amount, list of products in the order, recipient of
 *      the payment, etc. You cannot submit this form from the server-side;
 *      you must show it to the user, and the user will submit it.
 *
 *      'kkb_epay_billing_statement' accepts two arguments: an instance of
 *      the KkbEpay_Order class and a user account object.
 *
 *      When you copy data from your internal order into KkbEpay_Order object,
 *      do not forget about order ID (you can pass it into constructor).
 *      You also *must* add at least one KkbEpay_OrderItem into the order.
 *
 *   3. Implement hook_kkb_epay_payment().
 *
 *      This hook is called when processing center sends notification that a
 *      payment is completed. This is the place where you mark your orders as
 *      payed and grant access to your services.
 *
 *      This hook accepts one argument - an instance of
 *      KkbEpay_PaymentNotification.
 *      It has information about order ID, payment amount and payment time.
 *
 *   4. Optionally, implement hook_kkb_epay_success_page() and
 *      hook_kkb_epay_failure_page().
 *
 *      These hooks simply create a landing place on your site where a user is
 *      redirected after finishing payment. You can show a simple message
 *      that says that the payment was completed (or not), or just redirect
 *      user to some other page with drupal_goto(). If you want to display
 *      a message, you must return a Drupal renderable array, which you would
 *      normally return from any other menu callback.
 *
 *      Warning!
 *      Do not modify you orders in these hooks. User can simply go directly to
 *      the success page by entering its URL in a browser. These hooks must
 *      create a landing page only and must not modify any state on the site.
 *
 *      If you do not implement either of these hooks, 'kkb_epay' module will
 *      provide a default page with a generic message.
