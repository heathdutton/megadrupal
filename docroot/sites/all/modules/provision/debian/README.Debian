Aegir for Debian
----------------

This is part of the Aegir suite. This package takes care of installing
the provision file in the proper location so it's seen by Drush and sets
up some directories and the aegir user. Once this package is installed,
the frontend can be installed with the aegir-hostmaster package, or
the following command:

 su -u aegir -c 'drush hostmaster-install'

Aegir is installed under /var/aegir. I haven't gone through the trouble
of separating the directories to follow the FHS, as Aegir doesn't
support this well yet.

To migrate to this package, you need to first remove
/var/aegir/.drush/provision (this package will stop processing if it
finds it), then install the package, which should find the necessary
aliases and goods to do its own hostmaster-migrate. This procedure
will only work from 0.4-alpha9 and above:

  rm -rf /var/aegir/.drush/provision
  apt-get install aegir-provision
