Description: mass Drupal hosting system - backend
 A set of contributed modules for Drupal that aims to solve the
 problem of managing a large number of Drupal sites. It does this by
 providing you with a simple Drupal based hosting front end for your
 entire network of sites. To deploy a new site you simply have to
 create a new Site node. To backup or upgrade sites, you simply manage
 your site nodes as you would any other node.
 .
 This package provides Drush commands used for system level tasks such
 as creating configuration files and managing databases and backup
 files. It can be installed standalone although it is usually
 installed with the hostmaster frontend.

 This package provides the frontend web interface that users generally
 interact with. It's made up of a regular Drupal site with a custom
 install profile, module and theme.
 .
 This meta-package will dynamically install the frontend using drush
 and provision and as such doesn't bundle any files itself. Everything
 is downloaded on the fly during the install.
