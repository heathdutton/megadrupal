You've just installed a module, but now you need to configure it. Where is that
new menu item?

Drupal 7 modules can provide a configure link in their info files. It is shown
on the module configuration page, but it becomes a hassle to locate that link
once many modules are installed. This module fixes that annoyance by
redirecting to the configuration page when a single module is enabled or
displaying a list of configuration pages when more than one is available.

FEATURES:
Integrated with Drush
Guesses configuration page when configure isn't set

FUTURE FEATURES:
Make redirect optional.
