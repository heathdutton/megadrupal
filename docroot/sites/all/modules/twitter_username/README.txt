Module: Twitter Username
Author: Opi <http://drupal.org/user/263678>


Description
===========

This module provides a simple field for handling Twitter username,
which can be added to content types for validating and storing a
Twitter username.
This module only checks the syntax, not that the username really exists.

It defines 2 formatters, "plain text" and "link", where the username is
prefixed by @. Both formatters are themeable.


Installation
============

Copy the 'twitter_username' module directory in to your Drupal
sites/all/modules directory as usual.

Enable the twitter_username module by navigating to
administer > modules
