Unique (by) Datasource Identifier
---------------------------------

Udid create a new type of field to manage a unique identifier in a datasource.

So it creates a functional key on the Datasource ID and the Unique ID.

Udid also provide subfields to store a datasource branch (some variation of your datasource) and a version (some variation of your unique identifier). Those fields can be usefull if you need to merge populations of records...
