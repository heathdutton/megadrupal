To use the module, set the module variables at the admin page, then simply call
this function which will return the path and query of the paybox page :

paybox_pay($cents, $order_id, $payer_email, $destination = '', $currency = 'euro', $payment_method = 'cb')

$cents : the total to pay, in cents (integer)
$order_id : some string to identify this order
$payer_email : where the notifications will be sent
$destination : where to go back after payment
$devise : only 'euro' and 'USD' for the moment
$payment_method: refer to _paybox_payment_method function to know the codes.

The returned array can be used as $form_state['redirect'] in a form submit 
function.
If you want to know about the payment status (not only to display back a 
message to the user, but to provide reliable reports on payments), you can use 
this hook :

hook_paybox_update_status($order_id, $success, $info)

where $order_id is the same variable passed to paybox_pay, $success is a boolean which is false if the payment were refused, and 
$info is an array with further info about the payment.
