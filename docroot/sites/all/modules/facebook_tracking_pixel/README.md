Facebook Tracking Pixel
=======================

This module is meant to offer flexibility in adding Facebook tracking pixels to
your website. The difference in this module and other modules that allow you to
add codes to your page is that this is specifically targeted to Facebook
tracking pixels. You have the ability to add more than one tracking pixel per
page. This module also takes the code from Facebook as it is supplied by them
and optimizes it for loading on pages so it can be aggregated, compressed, and
pushed via a CDN if you wish.

Usage
=====

First step to the module is adding a base tracking code. The base ID is available
in your Facebook Account under Manage Ads->Tools->Pixels. On the right hand column
you will see your Account name and underneath that is the ID number. This is your
base code ID number.
