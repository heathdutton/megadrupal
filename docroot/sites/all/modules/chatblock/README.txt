1. ABOUT
========

This module provides an on site chat, located in a block. You can set separate
permissions for viewing and for joining chats.

Chatblock focuses on simplicity. It does not require additional resources like
IRC, Java or flash and although it is thoroughly built with Javascript, it even
works basically in no-script environments. While other modules provide much
more flexibility and manifold functions, chatblock aims to be easy to handle,
compact and save as much server CPU as possible.

Features:
* Easy to set up, simple to use.
* Ideal for any site that needs no more than *one* generic chat room.
* Can be easily placed in any block region on your site.
* Optionally, some basic smiley codes transform into graphical smileys 
  and links become clickable.
* Basic fallback functionality for users with Javascript disabled.
* Configurable chat logs (which can be cleaned up manually 
  and/or on cron runs).
* Separate access permissions for viewing and joining chats and chat logs.


2. TECHNICAL
============

A new block, called "On site chat", will be available on your block
administration page once you installed and activated the module.
The block provides a chat window displaying the recent chat messages and
a simple input form to add own messages. Both items require explicite
permissions (view, join).

The messages are both polled and posted with Javascript/AJAX by default.
Users without Javascript enabled will receive a gracefully degraded
functionality, but after all able to participate (this will be thoroughly
improved as soon as possible).

Performance may be improved by installing the JS callback handler, see
http://drupal.org/project/js_callback, and also by having APC available on your
web server (see http://pecl.php.net/package/APC for details). Chatblock
will integrate with both without needing additional configuration for itself.

The installation routine will attempt to copy a specialized callback handler
for polls to your Drupal root directory which, in most cases, will dramatically
speed up almost each single poll by bypassing most Drupal overhead.

3. QUICK REFERENCE
==================

* Activate the module at admin/modules.
* Configure user access at admin/people/permissions#module-chatblock.
* Note the new "On site chat" block in your block configuration at
  admin/structure/block and place it into your favorite region.
  Configure the block settings for block visibility but note that, for security
  reasons, users will need both the permission to view the block AND the
  permission to chat!
  Also note: If you are using modules that enable auto-refresh for blocks
  (such as block_refresh or blajax), DO NOT enable refreshing or even
  automatic refreshing for the chatblock as this will cause trouble and
  will also strongly affect your server load.
* Configure many more detailed chat settings at admin/config/chatblock.
* Optionally enable the additional menu items in your default menu
  (chat log and help page).
* Find a conditionally assembled info page at chatblock/infos
* Find the complete chat history at chatblock/logs and options for manual
  deletion at chatblock/logs/cleanup
* Check the status report (admin/reports/status) to find out about potential
  chatblock performance improvements.
* There is also a second block available providing the same information
  as the info page does but a little more compact. You may add this
  block e.g. below your chatblock as a quick reference for your users.

Introducing "smart poll"
------------------------
One of many measures to make chatblock as harmless as possible for your overall
server load is the option to constantly optimize the clients' poll intervals.

The big picture is to increase the intervals while there is no recent chat
activity and to set them back to the default value as soon as a new message
is posted. This is especially important if you configure chatblock to be
visible on any page in your site and, of course, the more visitors with
"view chats" permission you have.

The "smart poll" interval adjustment evaluates four information pieces:
val_1 = The minutes that have passed since the last message was typed.
val_2 = The value you have configured as "smart poll stepwidth" (minutes).
val_3 = The value you have configured as "default poll interval" (seconds).
val_4 = The value you have configured as "maximum poll interval" (minutes).
Given these values (and not having set val_2 or val_3 to "0"), the client will
recalculate the actual poll interval with the following (simplified) formula:

  actualInterval = min((val_1 / val_2) * val_3, val_4 * 60)

Translated to a phrase, you could say:

  "Increase the actual interval every val_2 minutes by val_3 until it reaches
  the limit defined by val_4, starting at the moment of val_1."

The actual calculation of course contains some more validation, but you should
have got it so far.

Some words on the impacts of every setting:

* DEFAULT POLL INTERVAL
  Simple: The lower the value, the more up-to-date every client at any time
  (and the higher the server load, of course). And vice-versa.
  RULE OF THUMB: 1-5 seconds on a dedicated chat page and with rather moderate
  users, 5-10 seconds for a very frequented block.
* SMART POLL STEPWIDTH
  Higher values mean slower adjustment and thus more server load. Lower values
  are better for your server but may cause delay before all clients are back
  after someone breaks the silence.
  RULE OF THUMB: Use a higher value (e.g. 4-10 minutes) on a dedicated chat
  page and lower values (e.g. 1-4 minutes) for blocks everyone can see
  everywhere.
* MAXIMUM POLL INTERVAL
  Again, simple: The higher your setting and the longer your chatters idle,
  the more wellness for your server. But also the longer until life turns
  back to the chat for everyone.
  RULE OF THUMB: None yet. You will have to find out yourself.

Final note: All this magic will not help once your cat becomes so
popular that a constant high number of chatters uses it with a constant
high frequency. Naturally.
   

4. CUSTOMIZING
==============

In order to keep chatblock as simple and lightweight as possible, all theming
functions have been removed. But of course you may still tweak the default
design by overriding/adding CSS definitions e.g. in your theme's CSS. Just
study the existing chatblock.css to learn about overridable items.

However you may also do some tweaks on the configuration page.

If you prefer your chat within its own "static" page, this is of course as
easy! Just create a page, eventually add some introducing lines and place
the chatblock in a content related region (this will most likely be "content"
in most themes. Set the block to appear only on the given page (path
inclusions/exclusions), voil√†!


5. ISSUES
=========

Chatblock is under constant development. Please check with the issue queue
at http://drupal.org/project/issues/chatblock?categories=All to
track (or add) bugs, requests etc.

5a. KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS
================================
Due to its internal design, the chatblock's submit button (labeled 'send'
in the untranslated version) will cause odd behaviours with the "hide submit"
module (http://drupal.org/project/hide_submit). It is recommended that you
add the following line to the "form id exclusion list" in the "Advanced"
section of the hide submit settings page:

chatblock_chatform

This will protect the button from unwanted effects.

6. FAQ
======

Please make sure you have read these questions before creating a bug
report or a support request. This section will be updated time by time.

Q: I have installed chatblock but messages are not updated. Why's that?
A: An HTTP based (near-)realtime chat is a complex system whith many caveats.
   One of them was a design flaw in the "smart poll" feature's initial set-
   tings which prevented all clients to poll very rarely directly after install
   so only clients would not update immediately unless they sent out a message
   theirselves. This issue is solved as of the 1.3 versions.

Q: I have the latest version installed but still no updates.
Q: I do see messages I have posted myself, but no messages from others.
   Same with others, everyone only sees his own posts. What is it?
A: Please make sure you have read the status report at admin/reports/status.
   In most cases, there is either a problem with caching; so check whether
   you have installed APC properly. On the APC server info page (see APC
   manual!) in the "user cache entries" section, you should see several
   variables named something like "chatblock_yourdomaincom_key". If not,
   there is something wrong with your PHP/APC configuration.

Q: I do not use APC. It still does not work! What now?
A: Because caching is vital for this module, chatblock will attempt to
   use a primitive file cache in a subdirectory of its module folder.
   You could have guessed that it has to do with that path, because
   the status report page mentioned high above does show a big red
   error message in this case.
