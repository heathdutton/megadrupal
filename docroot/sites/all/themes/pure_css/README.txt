Thank you for downloading this framework!


ABOUT YAHOO Pure.CSS FRAMEWORK:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Yahoo Pure.CSS framework is an advanced responsive, mobile-first, HTML5, 
base-theme, with layout and style configuration options built in that you can 
easily control through Drupal's UI. The framework includes two fine-tuned, 
fully featured end-user themes. It uses Yahoo Pure.css (http://purecss.io/), 
a powerful responsive CSS framework and also fully supports right to left 
languages. Pure is ridiculously tiny, being the fastest framework around.

The theme validates HTML5, it is cross-browser compatible, and it complies 
with WAVE (http://wave.webaim.org/) and FAE (http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/).

7.x-4.x is a complete redesign made with mobile in mind: compatible, light and fast.


Framework's features
====================
- CSS with a minimal footprint. Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of 
  modules clocks in at 4.0KB* minified and gzipped.
- A responsive grid that can be customized to your needs: 1, 2, or 3 column layout 
  with customizable widths. 
  Pure is responsive out of the box, so elements look great on all screen sizes.
- The Pure Grid system comes in two flavors: Standard and Responsive.
- Pure has several prebuilt common elements as grids, forms, buttons, tables, 
  paginators and CSS Dropdown menu.
- All modules in Pure build on top of Normalize.css (http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), 
  a well-known open source project that renders elements more consistently and 
  in line with modern standards and also works in older browsers.
- Advanced SEO optimization;
- 16 block regions;
- Duplicate the Main Menu at the bottom of the page;
- Helpful body classes (unique classes for each page, term, website section, theme settings, etc.);
- Possibility to change "Submitted by" display on all nodes;
- Theme's own slideshow;
- Social links integration;
- Bi-directional right to left (RTL) theming;
- All the theme settings are multilingual variables.

Pure.CSS sub-themes

or as a separate mobile theme (https://www.drupal.org/project/mobile_theme) 
together with the mobile theme module.

MODULE SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
This theme can support virtualy any module.


THEME MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you feel like giving the base-theme or any of the sub-themes a look of 
your own, I recommend to play with /_custom/custom-style.css; please read 
the comments in this file.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1) Place the pure_css directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/pure_css).
2) Enable the base-theme or any sub-themes (/admin/appearance).
3) Configure the default theme's settings at /admin/appearance/settings. 


UPGRADING to a new version of Pure.CSS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. If possible, log on as administrator user. 
2. Put the site in "Off-line" mode.
3. Check "Rebuild theme registry on every page".
4. Place the framework directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/pure_css).
   In case you have done customization to the base theme or any sub-themes, remember 
   to overwrite theme's custom-style.css with your modified custom-style.css file.
5. Clear cached data at admin/settings/performance or, if you use Administration 
   Menu module, "Flush all caches".
6. Put the site in "On-line" mode. It is always a good idea to refresh the browser's 
   cache (CTRL+F5).
7. Check the theme's settings. Remember that some of the theme's settings are 
   multilingual variables, so you can have different settings for each language.

NOTE: In some very rare cases, if after upgrading the theme can not be configured 
you should delete all the Pure.CSS records in the data base.
