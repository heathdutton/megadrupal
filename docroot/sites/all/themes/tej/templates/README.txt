The templates folder is here to organize any custom templates you have for your
subhteme.
The HTML5 Starterkit (and subthemes) uses all default templates in the Omega
base theme, and is why this directory is empty. 

Any page, node, etc. templates you need to customize can be copied here, and
customized accordingly.
