Mobile theme version 2.x for Drupal 7
-------------------------------------

===== DESCRIPTION

Mobile theme version 2.x is designed to present a clean, readable version of the website for consumption on mobile devices. It can be used by itself or as a base theme for a custom mobile theme you develop.

NB: This theme will not engage automatically on a normal website. You will need to either have a mobile version of the site on a mobile-specific (sub)domain, and designate Mobile theme (or your subtheme) as the default theme in the settings.php file for that mobile (sub)domain, or use a theme switcher to change themes dynamically.

===== INSTALLATION

Simply copy the Mobile theme folder and contents into your /sites/all/themes folder (or in the appropriate sites folder for a mobile subdomain URI, as appropriate) and enable.
