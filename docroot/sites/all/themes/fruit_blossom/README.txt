Fruit Blossom is based on the two themes "Delicious Fruit" and "Blossom".
Here are the changes made:
- Ported to Drupal 7.x and upsized to tablet landscape(1024X768).
- The header is shortend to 2/3 of the original height and divided into more
  regions.
- Submenus now have a new background to stand out more.
- Lots of 'white space' is removed to make the theme more condensed
  (better for tablets).
