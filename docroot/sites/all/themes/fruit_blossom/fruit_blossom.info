name = Fruit Blossom
description = Fruit Blossom is based on the two themes <a href="http://drupal.org/project/delicious_fruit">Delicious Fruit</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blossom">Blossom</a>. Here are the changes made: Ported to Drupal 7.x and upsized to tablet landscape (1024X768). The header is shortend to 2/3 of the original height and divided into more regions. Submenus now have a new backround to stand out more. Lots of 'white space' is removed to make the theme more condensed (better for tablets).
