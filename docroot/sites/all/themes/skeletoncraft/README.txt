SkeletonCraft was created to be a simple, yet robust Minecraft theme for Drupal. It can be easily modified using custom page templates or panels.

Add a custom.css file to the skeletoncraft/css folder and easily customize the theme CSS without modifying the original theme CSS. 

Uncomment line 10 of the skeletoncraft.info file to enable a custom CSS file. The theme does not include the file, so updating to new versions of SkeletonCraft will not affect your customizations in that file.

SkeletonCraft is based off of the Skeleton Responsive CSS Boilerplate. Check out http://getskeleton.com for more info on how to use it.
