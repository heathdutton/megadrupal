Thanks for downloading the Airy Blue theme, originally designed for Open Source
Catholic (www.opensourcecatholic.com) by Jeff Geerling of Midwestern Mac, LLC
(www.midwesternmac.com).


##############
To Install
##############

Download the theme from drupal.org, unzip the tarball, place it in
sites/all/themes or sites/example.com/themes, and go to the admin/build/themes
page on your Drupal site to enable the theme.


##############
Drupal 7 Port
##############

The Drupal 7 version of this theme is undergoing a complete rewrite. Please be
patient as we work out kinks in the theme's design.

Rounded Corners in Internet Explorer
##############
If you would like to give IE users and users of other older browsers the ability
to see the rounded corners enjoyed by CSS3-compatible browsers, please see the
Drupal issue #549590 and use the attached file: http://drupal.org/node/549590

Another solution is to implement a Javascript technique for making rounded
corners in IE 6, 7, 8, etc. Just search Google for 'IE Rounded Corners,' and
you'll be set!
