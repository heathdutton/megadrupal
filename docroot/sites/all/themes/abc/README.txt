README.TXT // ABC responsive theme for Drupal 7.

Thank you for downloading this theme!


ABOUT THE ABC THEME:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ABC is an advanced responsive, "mobile first", HTML5 theme with layout and 
style configuration options built in that you can control through Drupal's UI. 
It uses Yahoo Pure.css, a powerful responsive CSS framework and also fully 
supports right to left languages. Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set 
of modules clocks in at 4.0KB minified and gzipped.

The theme validates HTML5, it is cross-browser compatible, and it complies 
with WAVE (http://wave.webaim.org/) and FAE (http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/).

7.x-4.x is a complete redesign made with mobile in mind: compatible, light and fast.

THEME MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend to play
with /_custom/custom-style.css; please read the comments in this file.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1) Place the abc directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/abc).
2) Enable the ABC theme (/admin/appearance).
3) You can configure the theme's settings at /admin/appearance/settings/abc. 


UPGRADING to a new version of ABC theme
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. If possible, log on as administrator user. 
2. Put the site in "Off-line" mode.
3. Check "Rebuild theme registry on every page" at /admin/appearance/settings/abc
4. Place the abc directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/abc).
   In case you have done some theme customization, remember to overwrite theme's 
   custom-style.css with your modified custom-style.css file.
5. Clear cached data at admin/settings/performance or, if you use Administration 
   Menu module, "Flush all caches".
6. Put the site in "On-line" mode. It is always a good idea to refresh the browser's 
   cache (CTRL+F5).
7. Check the theme's settings at /admin/appearance/settings/zeropoint. Remember 
   that some of the theme's settings are multilingual variables, so you can have 
   different settings for each language.

NOTE: In some very rare cases, if after upgrading the theme can not be configured 
you should delete all the abc records in the data base.
