-- SUMMARY --

MaPS Admin is a very lightweight and clean theme for site administrators. It is
supposed to work outside overlays and has not been tested with this module.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.

-- HORIZONTAL SCROLL --

The main content wrapper uses an horizontal scrollbar that allows large table to be
fully accessible, without breaking the design or overriding some other data.

Using the mouse wheel to scroll horizontally can really improve your experience with this
theme. To enable this feature, you need to download the jQuery mousewheel plugin:
  https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel

http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/966/jQuery-Horizontal-automatic-Scrollbars-with-mouse

The plugin should be saved to the libraries folder with the name: "jquery-mousewheel". The
only necessary file is:
* jquery.mousewheel.js
