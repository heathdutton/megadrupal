# SeeD Theme - Sub theme
The templates folder is where you should put all your template files.
Our recommendation here is to us subfolders like this:

* Core
	* node.tpl.php
	* page.tpl.php
* Views
	* your-fancy-view.tpl.php
* ...

Again, itâ€™s just our way, feel free to use or not to use subfolders!
