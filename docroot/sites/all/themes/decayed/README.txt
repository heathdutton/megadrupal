Motivations
-----------
This theme is modified from Creative Commons template named "Colourise 1.0" (preview original at http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/Colourise1-0/index.html). The project is motivated from Thai Drupal Community (http://drupal.in.th/) with discussion about "Lacking of Thai documentations for Drupal theme creating".

So I wrote some articles in Thai to demonstrate "Drupal6.x theme porting from CSS free template" (http://webzer.net/tags/colourise). And the output is right now on your hands.


Inspirations
------------

1. Colourise 1.0 (http://styleshout.com) : Beautiful dark design with fixed width layout , a right sidebar , a nice image header and of course, valid XHTML/CSS. ). Otherwise, I change some typographic display to be more legible and more suitable for both English and Thai language.

2. Nathan Smith's Grid Design CSS framework (http://960.gs) : The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. (But this theme was altered to 900px width.)
