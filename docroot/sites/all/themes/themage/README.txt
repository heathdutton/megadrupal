THEMAGE
-------

Thank you for using an easily extendable theme that uses HTML5 + CSS3
to deliver a beautiful, accessible, user-friendly experience.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Move the 'themage' folder to your sites/all/themes directory.
2. Enable the theme by going to admin/appearance and clicking 'Enable'
3. To use this theme, click on 'Set default'
4. If you want to keep the default background you'll need to enable SVG's
    (Usually done in .htaccess with "AddType image/svg+xml svg")
