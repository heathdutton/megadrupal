Starkish is a compromize between the raw "Stark" theme and all the other bulky
framework themes. It includes NO CSS like Stark, div-less starter tpl.php's
and some convenient template.php functions for things like smart body classes.

Starkish is built to be hacked on, not to be used as a base theme. Edit as you wish.

Features
  * Smart body, node, comment, and block classes
  * Simple .info file for easy customization
  * Lack of any sort of theming, divs, or CSS
  * Option for registry rebuilds with page loads.

Installation
  * Download it.
  * Unpack it.
  * Put the folder in /sites/all/themes (or sites/yoursite.com/themes).
  * (Optional) If you rename the theme, rename the following items to your theme's name:
    - starkish folder
    - starkish.info
    - "starkish" in template.php and theme-settings.php (do a find/replace)
  * (Optional) Replace screenshot.png image with a 294x219 image of your theme.
  * Head to admin/build/themes to enable it and make it the default.
