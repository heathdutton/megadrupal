description = If you need a really simple layout with only the most basic features, then this template can be a good choice. It is completely free and may be used without any limitations or obligations. I kindly ask you to leave the design credit link in the footer, but it is only a request and not a requirement. If you remove the credits, please consider supporting my work in some other way.
