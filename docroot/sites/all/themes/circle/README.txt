Circle Base Theme for Drupal 7.x

-- SUMMARY --

This theme doesn't provide a lot of template files and doesn't improve
working with blocks and regions. But it works great with panels module
and other contrib modules depending on it.
It takes great thoughts from Zen, Mothership and Omega themes and some
functions that help in most of the projects.
Most of the functions are settings dependent, so you can turn them off
in your theme settings.

Created for Propeople internal use.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

This Drupal theme is intended for Drupal versions 7 only; it will not work
with Drupal 6 or below.


-- SUBTHEMING INSTRUCTIONS --

Copy STARTERKIT folder out of the theme folder and rename it to your theme name.
Open your theme folder and change the STARTERKIT.info to your themes name.
You're good to go!
