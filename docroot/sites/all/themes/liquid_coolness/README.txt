 -- SUMMARY --

Liquid Coolness is a cool colored, fluid width sub-theme of Bartik - Drupal 7 core's default theme.
It is basically an override of all color styles from Bartik leaving most other styles untouched, 
to be inherited from the original theme.

The Skinr module (http://drupal.org/project/skinr) is used for point and click styling of certain elements.
This must be downloaded, installed and enabled in the same manner as other contributed modules.
