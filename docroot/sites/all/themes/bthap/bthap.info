description = A base theme made for highly attractive people.

; This base theme does not force assumptions about the layout of your site, so
; it will only provide a single "content" region. This also makes this theme
; suitable for Panels Everywhere [1]. The sub-theme, however, is free to
; override this default.
regions[content] = Content

; This theme adopts The HTML5 Boilerplate [2] best practices as much as Drupal
; can sensibly support in a theme. Non-sensible things would include code that
; would more appropriate belong in a module because of its access to
; implementing hooks and invoking alters. Here we are adding the main CSS file
; that itself adopts normalize.css and adds various other useful tweaks.
