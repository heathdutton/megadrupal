Documentation
-------------

The [Omega 4.x documentation][omega_docs] is hosted on [drupal.org][drupal] as part of the handbook section. Please note that we are still in the process of writing the documentation. If you want to get involved, please contact us.

Sub Theming
-----------

The easiest way to create a new [WxT Omega][wxt_omega] based sub-theme is by using [Drush][drush]. [Omega][omega] itself comes with a very easy-to-use Drush command for generating sub-themes through a command-line wizard. You can start the sub-theme creation wizard by invoking `drush omega-wizard` in the command-line and specifying you wish to create a subtheme of [WxT Omega][wxt_omega].

It is worth noting that the Drush subtheme provided by Omega Wizard won't add your custom regions. Simply add the following custom region to your new subtheme's info file

```sh
regions[content_aside]  = Aside
regions[leaderboard]    = Leaderboard
regions[mega_menu]      = Mega Menu
regions[page_bottom]    = Page bottom
regions[page_top]       = Page top
```

Maintenance Mode Support (Settings.php)

```sh
$conf['install_profile'] = 'wetkit';
$conf['maintenance_theme'] = 'wetkit_omega';

$conf['maintenance_theme_suggestion'] = 'maintenance_page__internet';

$conf['maintenance_theme_suggestion'] = 'maintenance_page__wet';
