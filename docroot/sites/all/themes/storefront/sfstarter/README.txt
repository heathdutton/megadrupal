To create a subtheme of the Storefront theme, copy the sfstarter folder
into the root of your sites/all/themes (same level as your storefront
theme). Rename the folder to your new theme name, and rename the
SFSTARTER.info.txt file to YOURTHEME.info

From here you can begin to update your new theme. If you would like to
override a file from the Storefront theme, copy that file into your
subtheme, make your changes, and clear your cache.

COLOR MODULE
The color module files have been included in your subtheme to provide
better flexibility. If you would like to disable the color options,
simply remove the color folder from your subtheme.
