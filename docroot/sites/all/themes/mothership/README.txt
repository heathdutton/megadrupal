The mothership is a HTML5 basetheme that drop Drupals obscure love for wrapping everything into 2 divs & slapping on 3 css classes everywhere its possible.
This theme will NOT make your site look neat - but it will clean up the markup Drupal provides out of the box, provide settings to remove css classes in the markup.
This should make you daily work as a frontend developer much easier, and remove a lot of the frustration in plowing through the ton of unused css & markup.

If you really like the markup & css options that Drupal Provides - This theme is probably not for you, and thats perfectly ok, this theme won't do anything for you. If you on the other hand cares about clean markup & css -  This could be a good solution.
