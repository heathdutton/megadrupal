INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of plink is meant to be quick and easy. Download and place the default
plink theme files into your themes directory. Next you will want to make a copy of
the MYTHEME plink sub-theme. You can make a copy of the MYTHEME in the default plink
folder if you wish but it is recommended to make your copy into your site's themes
folder. Once you have a copy of the MYTHEME folder in your site's themes folder
rename it and the MYTHEME.info file into something a little more to your liking.
You will also have to find and replace all instances of "MYTHEME" in the MYTHEME.info
file and in the template.php file. Once you have done this you should be able to 
enable and start using Plink!



CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have your sub-theme installed you will want to configure the settings that
come right out of the box with plink. Navigate to your settings page 
eg: admin/appearance/settings/MYTHEME

For a detailed overview of the settings page please watch the instructional video
on youtube : PATH TO YOUTUBE VIDEO
