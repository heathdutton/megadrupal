description = This is Andreas1024px, a free website template by Andreas Viklund. This is a regular XHTML/CSS template which you can use to build your own website or online presentation. The Andreas1024px template is released as completely free code, which means that you are allowed to use it for any purpose and in any way you may want to, without any obligations or limitations. I kindly ask that you leave the credit text and link (the one that says "Design by Andreas Viklund" in the footer) since that is a nice way of supporting my template design work. But it is no requirement, just a request. Do what works best for you!
