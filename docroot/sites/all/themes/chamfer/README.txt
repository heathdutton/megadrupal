In order to fully enjoy chamfer make sure to enable the tinynav module (http://drupal.org/project/tinynav).

There’s also an included “banners” folder that has some banners that were created
with Online Art courses in mind. These images are fully GPL and are used in some
of the courses originally developed by the e-Learning Institute, who provided this
theme.
