##### Sasson - Advanced Drupal Theming. #####

This is the directory for all your blocks templates.

Default block template can be found here :
https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!block!block.tpl.php/7

Template suggestions:
block--module--delta.tpl.php
block--module.tpl.php
block--region.tpl.php

For example, "block--block--1.tpl.php" would be used for the first user-submitted
block added from the block administration screen since it was created by the
block module with the id of 1. "region" will take effect for specific regions.
An example of a region-specific template would be "block--sidebar_first.tpl.php".
