Create Views Slideshow for Waterloo Theme.

Slideshow is implemented in the "Featured" area. More detailed instructions are 
available at http://waterlootheme.intermedia-online.com/node/364

Step 1: Install relevant modules

Views and Views Slideshow are required for this feature
Views Slideshow also requires Libraries and the jquery.cycle plugin

Step 2: Create the content type

The included View requires a custom content type called "Slideshow Features". 
This content type should have fields for:

Image (use the existing field_image)
Link (new field, plain text) - will be used for the "read more" link.

The standard body field will be used for the description text that appears below
the image.
		
Step 3: Create a new image style

The Views slideshow in the Waterloo theme is designed to extend across the full 
width of the screen, which is set to a maximum width of 1200px. We will need a 
new image style for this purpose.

Go to Configuration > Image styles
Add a new style
Call it "Slideshow"
Add a new effect: "scale and crop"
Enter 1200 x 350 for the dimensions

If you want to be friendly to mobile devices, you probably don't want to serve 
them such a big image. In this case, you should set up a mobile image solution. 
There are several modules that can help with this. 

Step 4: Import the view

In views, import the view included in the views_slideshow.txt file.

Step 5: Add the block to the featured region.

Now you should have a block available called View: featured_slideshow. On the 
Block administration page, place this in the Featured region.
