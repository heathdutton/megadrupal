This file contains some documentation on the theme and some implementation 
instructions.

Waterloo is a responsive, colourable theme that is designed to be easy to set up
and customize. It is not meant to be all things to all people, but will 
hopefully be all things to some people :) 

The theme includes three colour options and six collapsible regions - just 
enough to suit your needs, but not too many to be overwhelming.

--- Colour recommendations ---

The main colour must be dark enough for white text to be readable on top of it 
on the main menu. It should also be bright enough to stand out appropriately 
from the dark grey featured region when it is in use, and to be readable against 
the beige sidebar background.

Choose the same colour for the "main colour" and for links. Depending on the 
colour you choose, however, you may need to make links a little brighter and 
more saturated so they stand out from the text colour.

Choose a dark colour for "text", like black or dark grey.

To ensure your colours stand out enough from the background, try using a Colour 
Contrast checker
(e.g. http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html)
Your "main" colour should work as a background with white text
on top, and as a foreground colour with beige (#E9DDCB) in the background.
