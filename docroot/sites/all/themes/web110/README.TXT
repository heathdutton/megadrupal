Drupal web110 theme.

Designed and developed by Thomas Lattimore (http://thomaslattimore.com)
A two column fixed width, 960px wide, tableLESS layout that is great for a simple blog or personal site. This is a great theme "right out of the box", and also is simple enough that it could be built upon with great ease.

| MAIN MENU IS A REGION |
I chose to make the main menu a block region as there can problems with drop down menus in Drupal outside blocks. 
To enable the main menu go to the blocks administration page, [front] /admin/structure/block, and drag the Main menu into the Main menu Region.
