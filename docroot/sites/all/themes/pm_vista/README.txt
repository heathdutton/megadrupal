WHAT IS PM VISTA?

Its a Theme and it focuses its entire energy on just one task.
Make PM look good.

PM Vista is a subtheme of Omega.
Project Page:   http://drupal.org/project/omega
You would need to enable Omega 3.x theme first to use 'PM Vista' theme.

It would be unfair to use
PM Vista for projects which doesn't have PM module, that would
be a terrible injustice to loads of theme overrides which lies
in the template preprocessing functions, focussing entirely on
making PM look good. Having said that, none-the-less, you can
use it for any drupal 7 project just like another omega sub-theme.

********************************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

0. Download latest stable version of Omega 3.x ( and not 4.x version ). Extract
   and Place 'omega' directory to your Drupal themes directory (normally
   sites/all/themes or themes).

1. Download and place 'pm_vista' directory into your Drupal themes
   directory.

2. Enable the 'Omega them' and 'Pm Vista' theme by navigating to:

     Administer > Appearance

3. Make 'PM Vista' your default theme.
