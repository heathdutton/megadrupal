# Toolkit v1.3.2 #

Titon Toolkit is a collection of very powerful user interface components and utility classes
for the responsive, mobile, and modern web. Each component represents encapsulated HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript functionality for role specific page elements.

Toolkit makes use of the latest and greatest technology. This includes HTML5 for semantics,
CSS3 for animations and styles, Sass for CSS pre-processing, Grunt for task and package management,
and powerful new browser APIs for the JavaScript layer.
