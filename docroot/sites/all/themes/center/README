Center is a base theme that aims to speed up the theming process by offering a starting point for building a custom theme and allowing easier access to CSS classes. Center is not for everyone, as it caters to theme developers who prefer developing in code, rather than the UI.

The primary goals of Center are to provide:
* Better access to CSS classes in markup.
* Better default markup.
* Reusable HTML components.

### Better access to CSS classes in markup.
Center does not add any CSS. It strips CSS away, leaving what can be considered vital or useful core CSS styles.  Center overrides many of Drupal's core templates and theme functions,  which allows theme developers better access to CSS classes via preprocess functions.

### Better default markup.
While the markup in Center is more clean than that of Stark, it isn't minimal. Semantic markup choices need to be made on a project specific basis. Center simply tries to create smart defaults and allow for easy overriding.

### Reusable HTML components.
Center includes alternative theme functions and templates. These can be applied via theme hook suggestions, which allows for targeted application of markup variations and more manageable templates.

Center makes a fine base theme on it's own, however it is developed in conjunction with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/prototype">Prototype</a>, a SASS based starter theme built to take advantage of Center.
