### Zentropy - The ultimate responsive HTML5 base theme ###

  Hi and thank you for downloading Zentropy!

  I hope that it is the last responsive HTML5 base theme for Drupal 7 that
  you try and that you enjoy using it as much as I have enjoyed developing it!

  I have spent countless hours and sleepless nights trying to create a theme
  that is at the same time clean and easy to use but that is also robust,
  acessible and fully standards-compliant.

  A lot of thought has gone into every feature and I believe that once you
  fully explore all the options and possibilities you will fall in love!

  If you have any doubts or questions please check out or FAQ, file an issue
  in the official issue queue: http://drupal.org/project/issues/zentropy and
  also check out our comprehensive handbook at: http://drupal.org/node/1515802

  That's it, now go create an awesome Subtheme!
