ABOUT AUSTIN
------------

Austin is a typographically driven theme, designed by Mark Boulton.

Austin (a Zen sub-theme) was created in partnership with Mark Boulton for the
"Iron Chef"-style competition at SXSW 2009. The competition, known as the
"Ultimate Showdown of Content Management System Destiny", brought three CMS
projects (Drupal, WordPress and Joomla!) together to build the same site and the
same theme under each platform. And then all the hard work was shared back with
our communities.

The sxsw project website is at http://cmsshowdown.com/drupal where each CMS
project's site, theme, and modules are available for download.
