Ingrained is a two column responsive design with narrow (sidebar) content on the left using the Omega base theme. Original design by Jozef Toth (www.mogdesign.eu), theme by Emma Jane and Design To Theme for the Responsive Web Design for Drupal workshop (www.responsivewebdesignguild.com).

--- Omega
This theme is a subtheme of the base theme Omega. You will need to download and install the following projects

http://drupal.org/project/omega
  Unpack the files and place them into sites/all/themes

http://drupal.org/project/omega_tools
  Unpack the files and place them into sites/all/modules

http://drupal.org/project/ctools
  Unpack the files and place them into sites/all/modules

Log in to Drupal as the administrator and enable the modules: Ctools, Omega Tools.

--- Installing Ingrained
    Place this folder (ingrained) into your site's theme directory. e.g. sites/MYSITE/themes/ingrained.
    Log into your Drupal site as the site administrator and enable the new subtheme.
    Navigate to Administration > Appearance.
    Scroll to the bottom of the screen and locate your subtheme.
    Click "Enable and set as default". (Note: you do not need to enable Omega itself.)
    Close the overlay.
Ingrained is now enabled and ready for customization.

--- Helper Styles
In the original design there is a gray and a blue sidebar. This has nothing to do with "responsive design" ... however, if you'd like multicolored blocks as well, install the helper module Block Class as described below. By default blocks will not be issued a background color by the ingrained theme. You'll need to add one if you don't want to use this helper module.

    Download the module Block Class from http://drupal.org/project/block_class. Unpackage it and place it in the Drupal folder, sites/all/modules.
    On your site, locate a block you'd like to color. Hover over it and then click on the cog icon (top right). Select "configure block".
    On the block configuration screen there is a new configuration option to apply a class to this block. In the text input area add blue or gray (even though it's a class, do not preface the class name with a period). Scroll to the bottom and click save.
    In your CSS file, add a corresponding style for your block. The CSS below includes styling for both blue and gray classes. You can add others if you'd like.

--- Disable Debugging Tools
If the pink grid is still appearing, your debugging tools are turned on. Complete the following steps to disable them:
    Navigate to Administration > Appearance. Locate your subtheme and click on Settings.
    Under Layout configuration, click on the vertical tab: Debugging.
    Disable the checkbox for Enable the debugging (placeholder) blocks for selected roles.
    Disable the checkbox for Enable the grid overlay for the selected roles.
    Scroll to the bottom of the configuration screen and click "save configuration".
