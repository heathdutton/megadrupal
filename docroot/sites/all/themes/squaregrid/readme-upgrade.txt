Updating Square Grid from previous versions

Every point release within a branch of Square Grid **should not** break any existing layouts. However, it's **strongly recommended** that you revisit your theme's Theme Settings after any update of Square Grid, as the theme configuration options may have changed.

If you are upgrading from one branch to another (e.g., 7.x-2.x to 7.x-3.x), do not expect backwards compatibility as each branch has major architectural differences from the others. You will very likely have to update your child theme to work with a new branch of Square Grid.
