Groundwork 7.x-2.0-beta2, 2013-10-xx To be released

* Changed all the color variables to have an HSV value of 60% except for
  @colorOrange which is OK as it is . This will make the colors tolerable in
  both dark and light background if used as text and dark and light text if used
  as background.
* Added the color variable @colorGrey which is at 50% HSV value.
* Added new font "Noceda Font Pro", for the new look of Groundwork. It is a
  light, elegant and open sans-serif font that can give a modern feel to
  websites. It has Gwikons and the Tagalog script (Baybayin).
* Deleted fonts Noceda Roman and Noceda Sans.
* Added support for Gwikons as mixins, and as classes in the resource
  folder.
* Issue #2103005 by ricmel111: Fixed media-query support in IE8. Added respond.js
  via a CDN in html.tpl.php
* Fixed link to docs found in groundwork.info. The correct link is
  http://groundwork.noceda.me/docs
* Modified ul in navigation.css.less to ul.menu
* Modified empty selector #navigation-wrapper. It should be #main-nav-wrapper
* Added new css3 mixin .border-shadow(). It creates borders by using box-shadow.
