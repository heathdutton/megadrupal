INTRODUCTION

Name:          Vert
Project type:  Theme
Base Theme:    NineSixty
Drupal:        7
Project Page:  http://drupal.org/project/vert
Maintainer:    Emma Jane Hogbin (http://drupal.org/user/1773)

This theme was originally created by Emma Hogbin for the Site Building
Extravaganza training program in 2011. It is a simple theme designed to
explore the NineSixty base theme with just enough PHP to make life 
interesting. This theme was used to build the (now mostly dismantled)
election Web site for Emma Hogbin in 2011 when she ran as a candidate for
the Green Party of Canada in the nation's federal election. Instructions
on how to build the complete election site are covered in Emma's book
Drupal User's Guide.

FONTS
-----

This theme relies on two custom fonts which are not licensed under the
GPL, but are free to use. The CSS file for this theme assumes you are 
downloading the fonts from the following locations:
  http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/League-Gothic
  https://github.com/emmajane/Font-Face-Kit-for-Steinem/zipball/master

Unzip the downloaded fonts and place the contents of both font kits 
into the directory:
    sites/all/themes/vert/fonts
No other changes should be necessary.
