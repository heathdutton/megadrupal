INTRODUCTION

This is a basic theme intended for sites that want to get away from the column feel, yet want to have a fluid look. This approach uses fixed-width content area to help ensure readability.

BASIC STYLING

As defined in this theme, the content area and "sidebar" blocks are sized proportionately to ensure a nice visual alignment. By default, the formula is such:

[content area] + 20px (right margin) = 2 * ([block] + 20px)


MOBILE

The mobile css is set to kick in at a point to complement the standard screen content and block widths. If you change the widths of your content and/or blocks, you may want to revisit your .info file to determine at what point the mobile css takes effect.


DEVELOPMENT NOTES

Once Drupal 7 stabilizes, I will be simplifying the regions structure prior to a 1.0 release.
