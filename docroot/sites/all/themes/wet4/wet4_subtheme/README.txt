-- SUBTHEME SETUP --

1. Copy and paste wet4_subtheme into your themes directory and rename it. For
   example if you are using sites/all/themes you can place it there - so you
   end up with:

   sites/all/themes/wet4_foo

2. Rename the info file and edit the info file details. For example lets assume
   you want your theme to be called "foo", the name of the info file will
   be "foo.info". Once you have renamed the file open it up and change
   the "name" to foo and change the description to suit your taste.

3. Enable the theme by going to admin/appearance. 

4. You can use the css/style.css file to provide your own CSS styling. You can
   use the supplied template.php file to provide your own theme overrides. To
   modify the templates, copy the file(s) you'd like to override from the parent
   theme's "template" folder to your subtheme's "template" folder.
