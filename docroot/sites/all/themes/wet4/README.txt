-- SUMMARY --

The Web Experience Toolkit 4 (WET_BOEW) theme is part of a suite that
implements the Web Experience Toolkit (v4.x) front-end framework into Drupal.
The framework, lead by the Government of Canada, is open-source and
collaborative, and is made to be accessible, mobile, and responsive. You can
find the full documentation here: http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index.html.

The Web Experience Toolkit distribution (https://www.drupal.org/project/wetkit)
is a content management system. If you prefer an out-of-the-box system, please
refer to the distribution.

This suite is meant for site builders who prefer to have a bit more control and
provides a simple roadmap for upgrading WET components. By decoupling the
features and leveraging Drupalâ€™s module and theming system, we are able to
provide quicker theme updates and keep the WET overhead low.

It is made to the WET's specs so that all features work:

* Mobile support, including menus
* Plugin support, including carousel, charts, tabs, and lightbox
* It includes both the Web Usability and Intranet theme
* It has multilingual support

A demo and full list of plugins can be found here:
http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/demos/index-en.html

This WET4 suite includes:

* WET4 theme
* WET4 Menu module
* WET4 Slider module
* WET4 Panel Layouts module
* WET4 Site Information module
* WET4 Migration module

-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see https://www.drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/
  themes for further information.

* Enable the theme and set it as default by going to Administration >
  Appearance.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Configure the theme like other themes by going to Administration > Appearance
  > Settings > WET4

  - You can set either the WEB or Intranet theme as the base theme.
  
* If you'd like to use the WET4 main menu style, please install the WET4_menu
  module found here: https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/ashopin/2433195.

* Drupal menu blocks or blocks created by the menu_block module can be used for
  the top links, sidebar menu, footer menus, and bottom menu.

  - Set the block title to <none> for proper styling
  
* Multilingual toggles should be placed in the top_links region as the last
  block for proper styling.
  
* The main menu can be up to 2 levels deep, but links will be stripped out of
  parent links in order to be accessible on touch screen devices.

* WET4 is more strict with its sidebar blocks. It is recommended that the
  sidebar be used for one menu block only. You can use the sidebar-aside region
  for content-related blocks.
  
-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* The theme includes a subtheme folder that can be used to provide full theme
  overrides.

  - To override a template, copy it from the Wet4 folder and paste it in your
  subtheme's template folder.
  
  - Rename the folder, .info file, and edit the .info file to include your
  custom theme's name.
  
  - You can use the css/style.css file to provide your style overrides or drop
  in SASS files into your subtheme folder and reference the compiled CSS in the
  subtheme's .info
  file.


-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

* If the menu does not display, check the following:

  - Are the "Access administration menu" and "Use the administration pages and
  help" permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?

  - Does html.tpl.php of your theme output the $page_bottom variable?

* If the menu is rendered behind a Flash movie object, add this property to your
  Flash object(s):

  <param name="wmode" value="transparent" />

  See http://drupal.org/node/195386 for further information.


-- FAQ --

Q: Can I install this theme on an existing WET distribution site?

A: Yes, this theme can be installed on new Drupal installation, existing
   projects, and WET distribution sites. Please keep in mind that there are
   quite a few variances between WET3 and WET4 (i.e the grid classes) so you
   may have to do a bit of restyling or restructuring.


Q: When I add more than one menu or add non-menu blocks to the sidebar, they
   disappear in mobile view.

A: WET4 is more strict with the type of content that can be placed in the
   sidebar due to the mobile JS library. All non-menu items will be stripped
   out and only the first menu in the sidebar will be used.
