Welcome to adaptIC!


INTRODUCTION
------------

adaptIC is a very simple responsive theme. I have been creating this for 
my own purposes but wanted to share with the community. 
This theme is probably best suited for a personal blog out of 
the box but could also be something more with a little work and a subtheme.
 

FEATURES
--------
This theme features a flexible grid and utilizes media queries to properly 
display your content to multiple devices.

ToDo
----
Better media queries for improved display
addition of left side bar
