1. Extract the files:

	When you first get the theme, it will appear in a compressed file
	format such as 'tar.gz'. On Windows, use a program like 7-Zip to extract
	it.

2. Upload the folder:

	You should create a sites/all/themes/ directory for contributed (non-core)
	themes and put uploaded themes there. If you are running a multi-site
	installation of Drupal, you can create a themes folder under
	sites/my.site.folder and put themes there that are specific to a particular
	site in your installation. Themes that will be shared between all sites
	should be placed in sites/all/themes.

3. Enable the theme:

	default" link of Insha theme to enable it.
