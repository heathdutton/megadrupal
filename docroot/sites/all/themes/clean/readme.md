# Clean theme

**A base theme with a focus on minimal implementation.**

Clean theme provides a solid foundation for creating bespoke themes in the shortest possible time.

## Features

* Collapsible layout
* Large default base font size
* Relative `em` font sizes
* Thorough use of CSS inheritance
* Default layout based around 960px grid
* 6.x version includes liquid, 960gs, 1kb grid, and light on dark sub themes.
* 7.x version includes ability to specify framework and conditional stylesheets in the info file.

## Usage

Clean theme should be used as a base theme. You should not edit the files in Clean theme but rather create a new theme to hold your custom code and set `base theme = clean` in the new theme's info file.

Using this method keeps Clean theme free of modifications, enabling easier updates.

For the same reasons you don't hack core, you shouldn't hack Clean theme.
