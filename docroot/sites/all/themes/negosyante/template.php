 * Process theme data.

 * Use this file to run your theme specific implimentations of theme functions,
 * such preprocess, process, alters, and theme function overrides.
 *
 * Preprocess and process functions are used to modify or create variables for
 * templates and theme functions. They are a common theming tool in Drupal, often
 * used as an alternative to directly editing or adding code to templates. Its
 * worth spending some time to learn more about these functions - they are a
 * powerful way to easily modify the output of any template variable.
