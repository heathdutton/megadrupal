README.TXT // BLACK HOLE responsive theme for Drupal 7.

Thank you for downloading this theme!


ABOUT THE BLACK HOLE THEME:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Black Hole is an advanced responsive, "mobile first", HTML5 theme with layout 
and style configuration options built in that you can control through Drupal's UI. 
It uses Yahoo Pure.css, a powerful responsive CSS framework and also fully 
supports right to left languages. Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set 
of modules clocks in at 4.0KB minified and gzipped.

The theme validates HTML5, it is cross-browser compatible, and it complies 
with WAVE (http://wave.webaim.org/) and FAE (http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/).

7.x-4.x is a complete redesign made with mobile in mind: compatible, light and fast.

MODULE SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
This theme can support virtualy any module.

  
THEME MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend to play
with /_custom/custom-style.css; please read the comments in this file.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1) Place the black_hole directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/black_hole).
2) Enable the Black Hole theme (/admin/appearance).
3) You can configure the theme's settings at /admin/appearance/settings/black_hole. 


UPGRADING to a new version of Black Hole
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. If possible, log on as administrator user. 
2. Put the site in "Off-line" mode.
3. Check "Rebuild theme registry on every page" at /admin/appearance/settings/black_hole
4. Place the zeropoint directory into your themes directory (sites/all/themes/black_hole).
   In case you have done some theme customization, remember to overwrite theme's 
   custom-style.css with your modified custom-style.css file.
5. Clear cached data at admin/settings/performance or, if you use Administration 
   Menu module, "Flush all caches".
6. Put the site in "On-line" mode. It is always a good idea to refresh the browser's 
   cache (CTRL+F5).
7. Check the theme's settings at /admin/appearance/settings/black_hole. Remember 
   that some of the theme's settings are multilingual variables, so you can have 
   different settings for each language.

NOTE: In some very rare cases, if after upgrading the theme can not be configured 
you should delete all the black_hole records in the data base.
